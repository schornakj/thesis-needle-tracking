  title = {Closed-Loop Asymmetric-Tip Needle Steering under Continuous Intraoperative {{MRI}} Guidance},
  doi = {10.1109/EMBC.2015.7319484},
  abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides excellent image contrast for various types of tissues, making it a suitable choice over other imaging modalities for various image-guided needle interventions. Furthermore, robot-assistance is maturing for surgical procedures such as percutaneous prostate and brain interventions. Although MRI-guided, robot-assisted needle interventions are approaching clinical usage, they are still typically open-loop in nature due to the lack of continuous intraoperative needle tracking. Closed-loop needle-based procedures can improve the accuracy of needle tip placement by correcting the needle trajectory during insertion. This paper proposes a system for robot-assisted, flexible asymmetric-tipped needle interventions under continuous intraoperative MRI guidance. A flexible needle's insertion depth and rotation angle are manipulated by an MRI-compatible robot in the bore of the MRI scanner during continuous multi-planar image acquisition to reach a desired target location. Experiments are performed on gelatin phantoms to assess the accuracy of needle placement into the target location. The system was able to successfully utilize live MR imaging to guide the path of the needle, and results show an average total targeting error of 2.5$\pm$0.47mm, with an average in-plane error of 2.09$\pm$0.33mm.},

  doi = {10.1109/ICRA.2011.5979539},
  abstract = {This paper presents the first prototype of a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compatible piezoelectric actuated robot integrated with a high-resolution fiber optic sensor for prostate brachytherapy with real-time in situ needle steering capability in 3T MRI. The 6-degrees-of-freedom (DOF) robot consists of a modular 3-DOF needle driver with fiducial tracking frame and a 3-DOF actuated Cartesian stage. The needle driver provides needle cannula rotation and translation (2-DOF) and stylet translation (1-DOF). The driver mimics the manual physician gesture by two point grasping. To render proprioception associated with prostate interventions, a Fabry Perot interferometer based fiber optic strain sensor is designed to provide high-resolution axial needle insertion force measurement and is robust to large range of temperature variation. The paper explains the robot mechanism, controller design, optical modeling and opto-mechanical design of the force sensor. MRI compatibility of the robot is evaluated under 3T MRI using standard prostate imaging sequences and average signal noise ratio (SNR) loss is limited to 2\% during actuator motion. A dynamic needle insertion is performed and bevel tip needle steering capability is demonstrated under continuous real-time MRI guidance, both with no visually identifiable interference during robot motion. Fiber optic sensor calibration validates the theoretical modeling with satisfactory sensing range and resolution for prostate intervention.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes an MRI-compatible, 1-axis force sensing unit which is designed to be used as a haptic interface on an MRI compatible robot. Recently, it became a popular research direction to enable MRI in surgical operations and brain studies with the help of robotic devices. However, due to high magnetic field in MRI environment, conventional sensors and robots cannot be used in MRI rooms. Existing MRI-compatible force sensors have limited number of degrees of freedom or they do not offer compact solutions for multiple-axis sensing. In this paper, a compact 1-axis force sensing unit which employs a compliant displacement amplification mechanism is introduced and then analyzed for better sensitivity and accuracy. A combination of multiple proposed sensing units can be assembled to have a force sensor with desired number of degrees of freedom. Prototypes made of delrin and ABS-plastic are tested. Experiments indicated that the proposed sensor is suitable for force sensing and fully compatible to MRI. Also, the sensor made of delrin is superior in mechanical performance and MRI compatibility to ABS-plastic sample.},

Data were collected from bovine livers using a one-degree-of-freedom robot equipped with a load cell and needle attachment. computed tomography imaging was used to segment the needle insertion process into phases identifying different relative velocities between the needle and tissue. The data were measured and modeled in three parts: 1) capsule stiffness, a nonlinear spring model; 2) friction, a modified Karnopp model; and 3) cutting, a constant for a given tissue. In addition, we characterized the effects of needle diameter and tip type on insertion force using a silicone rubber phantom. In comparison to triangular and diamond tips, a bevel tip causes more needle bending and is more easily affected by tissue density variations. Forces for larger diameter needles are higher due to increased cutting and friction forces.},

  abstract = {Image guidance promises to improve targeting accuracy and broaden the scope of medical procedures performed with needles. This paper takes a step toward automating the guidance of a flexible tip-steerable needle as it is inserted into the human tissue. We build upon a previously proposed nonholonomic model of needles that derive steering from asymmetric bevel forces at the tip. The bevel-tip needle is inserted and rotated at its base in order to steer it in 6 DOF. As a first step for control, we show that the needle tip can be automatically guided to a planar slice of the tissue as it is inserted. Our approach keeps the physician in the loop to control insertion speed. The distance of the needle tip position from the plane of interest is used to drive an observer-based feedback controller that we prove is locally asymptotically stable. Numerical simulations demonstrate a large domain of attraction and robustness of the controller in the face of parametric uncertainty and measurement noise. Physical experiments with tip-steerable nitinol needles inserted into a transparent plastisol tissue phantom under stereo image guidance validate the effectiveness of our approach.},

However, the benefits cannot be readily harnessed for interventional procedures due to difficulties that surround the use of high-field (1.5T or greater) MRI. The inability to use conventional mechatronics and the confined physical space makes it extremely challenging to access the patient. We have designed a robotic assistant system that overcomes these difficulties and promises safe and reliable intraprostatic needle placement inside closed high-field MRI scanners. MRI compatibility of the robot has been evaluated under 3T MRI using standard prostate imaging sequences and average SNR loss is limited to 5\%. Needle alignment accuracy of the robot under servo pneumatic control is better than 0.94 mm rms per axis. The complete system workflow has been evaluated in phantom studies with accurate visualization and targeting of five out of five 1 cm targets.

This approach provides a method for quantifying the needle forces and soft tissue deformations that occur during general needle trajectories in multiple dimensions. The needle force distribution is used for graphical and haptic real-time simulations of needle insertion. Since the force displacement relationship is required only along the needle, a condensation technique is shown to achieve very fast interactive simulations.

  abstract = {A flexible needle can be accurately steered by robotically controlling the bevel tip orientation as the needle is inserted into tissue. Friction between the long, flexible needle shaft and the tissue can cause a significant discrepancy between the orientation of the needle tip and the orientation of the base where the needle angle is controlled. Our experiments show that several common phantom tissues used in needle steering experiments impart substantial friction forces to the needle shaft, resulting in a lag of more than 45deg for a 10 cm insertion depth in some phantoms; clinical studies report torques large enough to cause similar errors during needle insertions. Such angle discrepancies will result in poor performance or failure of path planners and image-guided controllers, since the needles used in percutaneous procedures are too small for state-of-the-art imaging to accurately measure the tip angle. To compensate for the angle discrepancy, we develop an estimator using a mechanics-based model of the rotational dynamics of a needle being inserted into tissue. Compared to controllers that assume a rigid needle in a frictionless environment, our estimator-based controller improves the tip angle convergence time by nearly 50\% and reduces the path deviation of the needle by 70\%.},

  abstract = {As a flexible needle with a bevel tip is pushed through soft tissue, the                     asymmetry of the tip causes the needle to bend. We propose that, by using                     nonholonomic kinematics, control, and path planning, an appropriately designed                     needle can be steered through tissue to reach a specified 3D target. Such                     steering capability could enhance targeting accuracy and may improve outcomes                     for percutaneous therapies, facilitate research on therapy effectiveness, and                     eventually enable new minimally invasive techniques. In this paper, we consider                     a first step toward active needle steering: design and experimental validation                     of a nonholonomic model for steering flexible needles with bevel tips.

  abstract = {Flexible needles with bevel tips are being developed as useful tools for minimally invasive surgery and percutaneous therapy. When such a needle is inserted into soft tissue, it bends due to the asymmetric geometry of the bevel tip. This insertion with bending is not completely repeatable. We characterize the deviations in needle tip pose (position and orientation) by performing repeated needle insertions into artificial tissue. The base of the needle is pushed at a constant speed without rotating, and the covariance of the distribution of the needle tip pose is computed from experimental data. We develop the closed-form equations to describe how the covariance varies with different model parameters. We estimate the model parameters by matching the closed-form covariance and the experimentally obtained covariance. In this work, we use a needle model modified from a previously developed model with two noise parameters. The modified needle model uses three noise parameters to better capture the stochastic behavior of the needle insertion. The modified needle model provides an improvement of the covariance error from 26.1\% to 6.55\%.},

Based on the stochastic model for the needles, we develop a new framework for path planning of a flexible needle with a bevel tip. This consists of three parts: (a) approximation of probability density functions for the needle tip pose; (b) application of a second order error propagation algorithm on the Euclidean motion group; and (c) application of the path-of-probability (POP) algorithm. The probability density functions are approximated as Gaussians under the assumption that the uncertainty in the needle insertion is fairly small. The means and the covariances for the probability density functions are estimated using the error propagation algorithm that has second order accuracy. The POP algorithm is adapted to the path planning for the flexible needles so as to give the appropriate steering plan. Combining these components and considering 5 degree-of-freedom targets, the new method gives the path of the flexible needle that hits the target point with the desired hitting direction.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To quantify needle placement accuracy of magnetic resonance image (MRI)-guided core needle biopsy of the prostate.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 10 biopsies were performed with 18-gauge (G) core biopsy needle via a percutaneous transperineal approach. Needle placement error was assessed by comparing the coordinates of preplanned targets with the needle tip measured from the intraprocedural coherent gradient echo images. The source of these errors was subsequently investigated by measuring displacement caused by needle deflection and needle susceptibility artifact shift in controlled phantom studies. Needle placement error due to misalignment of the needle template guide was also evaluated.
RESULTS: The mean and standard deviation (SD) of errors in targeted biopsies was 6.5 +/- 3.5 mm. Phantom experiments showed significant placement error due to needle deflection with a needle with an asymmetrically beveled tip (3.2-8.7 mm depending on tissue type) but significantly smaller error with a symmetrical bevel (0.6-1.1 mm). Needle susceptibility artifacts observed a shift of 1.6 +/- 0.4 mm from the true needle axis. Misalignment of the needle template guide contributed an error of 1.5 +/- 0.3 mm.
CONCLUSION: Needle placement error was clinically significant in MRI-guided biopsy for diagnosis of prostate cancer. Needle placement error due to needle deflection was the most significant cause of error, especially for needles with an asymmetrical bevel.},

The robot-assisted minimally-invasive surgery is well recognized as a feasible solution for diagnosis and treatment of the prostate cancer in human.

Methods
In this paper the kinematics of a parallel 4 Degrees-of-Freedom (DOF) surgical manipulator designed for minimally invasive in-bore prostate percutaneous interventions through the patient's perineum. The proposed manipulator takes advantage of 4 sliders actuated by MRI-compatible piezoelectric motors and incremental rotary encoders. Errors, mostly originating from the design and manufacturing process, need to be identified and reduced before the robot is deployed in the clinical trials.

Results
The manipulator has undergone several experiments to evaluate the repeatability and accuracy of the needle placement which is an essential concern in percutaneous prostate interventions.

Conclusion
The acquired results endorse the sustainability, precision (about 1 mm in air (in x or y direction) at the needle's reference point) and reliability of the manipulator.},

  abstract = {A new method for MRI needle tracking within a given two-dimensional (2D) image slice is presented. The method is based on k-space investigation of the difference image between the current dynamic frame and a reference frame. Using only a few central k-lines of the difference image and a nonlinear optimization procedure, one can resolve the parameters that define the 2D sinc function that best characterizes the needle in k-space. The spatial location and orientation of the needle are determined from these parameters. Rapid needle tracking is obtained by repeated acquisitions of the same set of several central k-lines (as in a ``keyhole'' protocol) and repeated computation of these parameters. The calculated needle tip is depicted on the reference image by means of a graphic overlay. The procedure was tested in computer simulations and in actual MRI scans (the computations were done offline). It was demonstrated that six k-lines out of 128 usually suffice to locate the needle. The refresh rate of the needle location depends on the time required to sample the subset of k-lines, calculate the current needle location, and refresh the reference image.

As the field of MR-guided procedures continues to expand and to attract more attention from radiologists, it is important to understand the concepts, techniques, applications, advantages, and limitations of MR-guided biopsy/percutaneous procedures. Radiologists should also recognize the need for their significant involvement in the technical aspects of MR-guided procedures, since several user-defined parameters can alter device visualization in the MR imaging environment and affect procedure safety.

On top of this framework, the software provides the following features for needle guidance: interactive target planning; 3D image visualization with current needle position; treatment monitoring through real-time MR images of needle trajectories in the prostate. These features are supported by calibration of robot and image coordinates by fiducial-based registration.

With increasing research on system integration for image-guided therapy (IGT), there has been a strong demand for standardized communication among devices and software to share data such as target positions, images and device status.

Method
We propose a new, open, simple and extensible network communication protocol for IGT, named OpenIGTLink, to transfer transform, image and status messages. We conducted performance tests and use-case evaluations in five clinical and engineering scenarios.

Results
The protocol was able to transfer position data with submillisecond latency up to 1024 fps and images with latency of $<$10 ms at 32 fps. The use-case tests demonstrated that the protocol is feasible for integrating devices and software.

Conclusion
The protocol proved capable of handling data required in the IGT setting with sufficient time resolution and latency. The protocol not only improves the interoperability of devices and software but also promotes transitions of research prototypes to clinical applications..},

  abstract = {This paper reports the development of an MRI-Safe robot for direct (interventional) MRI-guided endorectal prostate biopsy. The robot is constructed of nonmagnetic and electrically nonconductive materials, and is electricity free, using pneumatic actuation and optical sensors. Targeting biopsy lesions of MRI abnormality presents substantial clinical potential for the management of prostate cancer., The paper describes MRI-Safe requirements, presents the kinematic architecture, design and construction of the robot, and a comprehensive set of preclinical tests for MRI compatibility and needle targeting accuracy. The robot has a compact and simple 3 degree-of-freedom (DoF) structure, two for orienting a needle-guide and one to preset the depth of needle insertion. The actual insertion is performed manually through the guide and up to the preset depth. To reduce the complexity and size of the robot next to the patient, the depth setting DoF is remote., Experimental results show that the robot is safe to use in any MRI environment (MRI-Safe). Comprehensive MRI tests show that the presence and motion of the robot in the MRI scanner cause virtually no image deterioration or signal to noise ratio (SNR) change. Robot's accuracy in bench test, CT-guided in-vitro, MRI-guided in-vitro and animal tests are 0.37mm, 1.10mm, 2.09mm, and 2.58mm respectively. These values are acceptable for clinical use.},

Robot-assisted needle steering has the potential to improve the effectiveness of existing medical procedures and enable new ones by allowing increased accuracy through more dexterous control of the needle-tip path and acquisition of targets not accessible by straight-line trajectories. In this article, we describe a robot-assisted needle-steering system that uses three integrated controllers: a motion planner concerned with guiding the needle around obstacles to a target in a desired plane, a planar controller that maintains the needle in the desired plane, and a torsion compensator that controls the needle-tip orientation about the axis of the needle shaft.},

  abstract = {Needle insertion is commonly performed in minimally invasive medical procedures such as biopsy and radiation cancer treatment. During such procedures, accurate needle tip placement is critical for correct diagnosis or successful treatment. Accurate placement of the needle tip inside tissue is challenging, especially when the target moves and anatomical obstacles must be avoided. We develop a needle steering system capable of autonomously and accurately guiding a steerable needle using two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound images. The needle is steered to a moving target while avoiding moving obstacles in a three-dimensional (3D) non-static environment. Using a 2D ultrasound imaging device, our system accurately tracks the needle tip motion in 3D space in order to estimate the tip pose. The needle tip pose is used by a rapidly exploring random tree-based motion planner to compute a feasible needle path to the target. The motion planner is sufficiently fast such that replanning can be performed repeatedly in a closed-loop manner. This enables the system to correct for perturbations in needle motion, and movement in obstacle and target locations. Our needle steering experiments in a soft-tissue phantom achieves maximum targeting errors of 0.86 $\pm$ 0.35 mm (without obstacles) and 2.16 $\pm$ 0.88 mm (with a moving obstacle).},

Current catheter placement techniques are limited to straight trajectories. The development of an inexpensive system for flexible percutaneous intracranial navigation may be of significant clinical benefit.OBJECTIVE:Utilizing duty-cycled spinning of a flexible bevel-tipped needle, the authors devised and tested a means of achieving nonlinear trajectories for the navigation of catheters in the brain, which may be applicable to a wide variety of neurological diseases.METHODS:Exploiting the bending tendency of bevel-tipped needles due to their asymmetry, the authors devised and tested a means of generating curvilinear trajectories by spinning a needle with a variable duty cycle (ie, in on-off fashion). The technique can be performed using image guidance, and trajectories can be adjusted intraoperatively via joystick. Fifty-eight navigation trials were performed during cadaver testing to demonstrate the efficacy of the needle-steering system and to test its precision.RESULTS:The needle-steering system achieved a target acquisition error of 2 $\pm$ 1 mm, while demonstrating the ability to reach multiple targets from one burr hole using trajectories of varying curvature.CONCLUSION:The accuracy of the needle-steering system was demonstrated in a cadaveric model. Future studies will determine the safety of the device in vivo.},

  abstract = {Discretely actuated steerable cannula is a multi-degree-of-freedom hollow needle (cannula) that could potentially be used in needle-based procedures to deliver therapeutic and diagnostic tools to a target region through its hollow inner core. Needle-based procedures are commonly performed using intra-operative image guidance. 2D ultrasound is one of the most commonly used imaging modalities in clinics. It is portable, inexpensive and free of ionizing radiation. The success of the needle-based procedures depends on accurate detection of the needle. The accuracy of the out-of-plane detection, where the ultrasound transducer is placed at a right angle to the long-axis of the needle, depends on the ultrasound beam width. Finite width of the ultrasound beam and uniform cross-section of the needle introduce errors in tracking. The accuracy of in-plane tracking depends on the tracking algorithm used and the spatial resolution of the ultrasound transducer. This work presents a method to quantify the finite ultrasound beam width and the spatial accuracy of the transducer. An out-of-plane detection method was implemented to locate the tip of the discretely actuated steerable cannula. An in-plane tracking algorithm based on optical flow was also developed to obtain the shape of a planar cannula. The algorithms and the methods developed in this work are general and they can be extended to needles having straight, curved and arbitrary shapes.},

We present a new needle steering system capable of automatically reaching targets in 3-D environments while avoiding obstacles and compensating for real-world uncertainties. Given a specification of anatomical obstacles and a clinical target (e.g., from preoperative medical images), our system plans and controls needle motion in a closed-loop fashion under sensory feedback to optimize a clinical metric. We unify planning and control using a new fast algorithm that continuously replans the needle motion. Our rapid replanning approach is enabled by an efficient sampling-based rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) planner that achieves orders-of-magnitude reduction in computation time compared with prior 3-D approaches by incorporating variable curvature kinematics and a novel distance metric for planning. Our system uses an electromagnetic tracking system to sense the state of the needle tip during the procedure. We experimentally evaluate our needle steering system using tissue phantoms and animal tissue ex vivo. We demonstrate that our rapid replanning strategy successfully guides the needle around obstacles to desired 3-D targets with an average error of less than 3 mm.},

  abstract = {Needle insertions are common during surgical procedures. Accurately delivering the needle at a specific location in the human body is of importance for the clinical outcome of the procedure. Studies have already shown that robotically inserting traditional needles with a bevel tip can improve targeting accuracy. However, steering of such needles requires spinning the needle, which may lead to additional tissue damage. Therefore, we propose a novel design consisting of a flexible needle with a tendon-driven actuated-tip. Changing the orientation of the actuated-tip allows to control the steering direction of the needle and the amount of deflection. We derive the kinematic model which describes the needle path given the actuated-tip orientation based on nonholonomic kinematics. We present a method for steering the needle towards a target location in soft tissue. This method incorporates online parameter estimation in order to adapt for changes in tissue stiffness. Needle insertion experiments are performed in soft-tissue simulants, made from porcine gelatin. Needle tip pose is measured during insertion using Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) based shape reconstruction. Results show that the needle can be steered towards targets located at 20 mm from the initial insertion axis, at a depth of 100 mm with a mean targeting error of 2.02 mm.},

the two. Additionally, transitions between phantom layers can
be easily detected. Furthermore, needle rotation was performed
under real-time MR imaging showing active compensation can
be performed during continuous cooperative insertions. Finally,
the robot's effect on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was performed

In this paper, an image-guided control system is developed to robotically steer flexible needles with an asymmetric tip. Knowledge about needle deflection is required for accurate steering. Two different models to predict needle deflection are presented. The first is a kinematics-based model, and the second model predicts needle deflection that is based on the mechanics of needle-tissue interaction. Both models predict deflection of needles that undergo multiple bends. The maximum targeting errors of the kinematics-based and the mechanics-based models for 110-mm insertion distance using a $\varphi$ 0.5-mm needle are 0.8 and 1.7 mm, respectively. The kinematics-based model is used in the proposed image-guided control system. The control system accounts for target motion during the insertion procedure by detecting the target position in each image frame. Five experimental cases are presented to validate the real-time control system using both camera and ultrasound images as feedback. The experimental results show that the targeting errors of camera and ultrasound image-guided steering toward a moving target are 0.35 and 0.42 mm, respectively. The targeting accuracy of the algorithm is sufficient to reach the smallest lesions ($\varphi$ 2 mm) that can be detected using the state-of-the-art ultrasound imaging systems.},

  abstract = {Purpose
To evaluate the validity of different approaches to determine the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in MRI experiments with multi-element surface coils, parallel imaging, and different reconstruction filters.
Materials and Methods
Four different approaches of SNR calculation were compared in phantom measurements and in vivo based on: 1) the pixel-by-pixel standard deviation (SD) in multiple repeated acquisitions; 2) the signal statistics in a difference image; and 3) and 4) the statistics in two separate regions of a single image employing either the mean value or the SD of background noise. Different receiver coil systems (with one and eight channels), acquisitions with and without parallel imaging, and five different reconstruction filters were compared.
Results
Averaged over all phantom measurements, the deviations from the reference value provided by the multiple-acquisitions method are 2.7\% (SD 1.6\%) for the difference method, 37.7\% (25.9\%) for the evaluation of the mean value of background noise, and 34.0\% (38.1\%) for the evaluation of the SD of background noise.
Conclusion
The conventionally determined SNR based on separate signal and noise regions in a single image will in general not agree with the true SNR measured in images after the application of certain reconstruction filters, multichannel reconstruction, or parallel imaging.

  abstract = {The three-dimensional (3D) modeling and recognition of 3D objects have been traditionally performed using local features to represent the underlying 3D surface. Extraction of features requires cropping of several local surface patches around detected keypoints. Although an important step, the extraction and representation of such local patches adds to the computational complexity of the algorithms. This paper proposes a novel Keypoints-based Surface Representation (KSR) technique. The proposed technique has the following two characteristics: (1) It does not rely on the computation of features on a small surface patch cropped around a detected keypoint. Rather, it exploits the geometrical relationship between the detected 3D keypoints for local surface representation. (2) KSR is computationally efficient, requiring only seconds to process 3D models with over 50,000 points with a MATLAB implementation. Experimental results on the UWA and Stanford 3D models dataset suggest that it can accurately perform pairwise and multiview range image registration (3D modeling). KSR was also tested for 3D object recognition with occluded scenes. Recognition results on the UWA dataset show that the proposed technique outperforms existing methods including 3D-Tensor, VD-LSD, keypoint-depth based feature, spherical harmonics and spin image with a recognition rate of 95.9\%. The proposed approach also achieves a recognition rate of 93.5\% on the challenging Ca'Fascori dataset compared to 92.5\% achieved by game-theoretic. The proposed method is computationally efficient compared to state-of-the-art local feature methods.},

Our method uses image gradients to transition between stereo-matching (which is more accurate at large gradients) and Lambertian shape-from-shading (which is more robust in flat regions). In addition, we show that our formulation is invariant to spatially varying albedo without explicitly modeling it. We show that the resulting energy function can be optimized efficiently using a smooth surface representation based on bicubic patches, and demonstrate that this algorithm outperforms both previous multi-view stereo algorithms and shading based refinement approaches on a number of datasets.},

Three main contributions are presented. First, we propose an algorithm for generating configurable marker dictionaries (in size and number of bits) following a criterion to maximize the inter-marker distance and the number of bit transitions. In the process, we derive the maximum theoretical inter-marker distance that dictionaries of square binary markers can have. Second, a method for automatically detecting the markers and correcting possible errors is proposed. Third, a solution to the occlusion problem in augmented reality applications is shown. To that aim, multiple markers are combined with an occlusion mask calculated by color segmentation. The experiments conducted show that our proposal obtains dictionaries with higher inter-marker distances and lower false negative rates than state-of-the-art systems, and provides an effective solution to the occlusion problem.},

  title = {Towards {{MRI}}-Guided Flexible Needle Steering Using Fiber {{Bragg}} Grating-Based Tip Tracking},
  doi = {10.1109/ICRA.2017.7989564},
  abstract = {The use of magnetic resonance (MR) images for needle-based interventions offers several advantages over other types of imaging modalities (e.g., high tissue contrast and no radiation). However, MR-guided interventions face challenges related to electromagnetic compatibility of medical devices and real-time tracking of surgical instruments. This work presents a flexible needle steering system that combines an MR-compatible robot and a Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG)-based needle tip tracker. The MR images are used to localize obstacles and targets, while the FBG sensors provide strain measurements for online estimation of the needle tip position. A pre-operative planner defines the needle entry point and desired path, while a model predictive controller calculates the needle rotation during the insertion. To the best of the authors knowledge, this is the first work that fuses MR images and FBG-based tracking to steer a flexible needle in closed-loop inside the MR bore. The system is validated by steering a bevel-tipped flexible needle towards a physical target in gelatin phantoms and biological tissues. The needle reaches the target in all trials with an average targeting error of 2.76 mm. Disregarding the target displacement during the insertion, the average targeting error drops to 1.74 mm. The preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of combining MR images and FBG-based needle tip tracking to steer a flexible needle in clinical procedures. In order to move towards to a clinically-relevant application, the design of a flexible Nitinol biopsy needle is also presented and evaluated by experiments in a prostate of a bull. The flexible needle presented a curvature 2.5 times larger than a conventional biopsy needle while maintaining the ability to collect tissue samples.},

Ten prostate cancer patients underwent HDR-BT during which the sagittally assisted sagittally reconstructed (SASR) segmentation technique was completed in parallel with commercially available sagittally assisted axially reconstructed (SAAR) TRUS for comparison. The SASR technique makes use of live 2D ultrasound intraoperatively and allows needle tip updates using the final 3D image in the absence of image artifacts. These updates were repeated offline twice by two separate users. Needle end-length measurements were used to calculate insertion depth errors (IDEs) for each technique. Images of 147 needles were analyzed. For the SASR technique, both users were confident in tip positions on the final 3D image within 3~mm for 52\% of needles, so these tip positions were updated. For the remaining 48\% of needles, the tip positions from the live 2D images were used. This SASR technique enabled the localization of all needles with IDEs within $\pm$3~mm for 84\% of needles and IDE range of [-6.2~mm, 5.9~mm], compared with 57\% and [-8.1~mm, 7.7~mm] when using the commercially available SAAR technique. The SASR technique mitigates the impact of 3D TRUS image artifacts on~HDR-BT needle tip localization by incorporating live 2D sagittal TRUS intraoperatively and provides a statistically significant reduction in IDE variance compared with the routine SAAR technique.},

A flexible representation of tissue microstructure is achieved in MRiLab by employing the generalized tissue model with multiple exchanging water and macromolecular proton pools rather than a system of independent proton isochromats typically used in previous simulators. The computational power needed for simulation of the biologically relevant tissue models in large 3D objects is gained using parallelized execution on GPU. Three simulated and one actual MRI experiments were performed to demonstrate the ability of the new simulator to accommodate a wide variety of voxel composition scenarios and demonstrate detrimental effects of simplified treatment of tissue micro-organization adapted in previous simulators. GPU execution allowed 200\texttimes{} improvement in computational speed over standard CPU.

While magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) are potential three-dimensional (3D) alternatives they generate metal-related artifacts. This study aims to quantify the artifact size from orthopaedic screws using CT, 1.5T and 3T MRI data. Three screws were inserted into one intact human cadaver ankle specimen proximal to and along the distal articular surface, then CT, 1.5T and 3T MRI scanned. Four types of screws were investigated: titanium alloy (TA), stainless steel (SS) ({\O} =3.5 mm), cannulated TA (CTA) and cannulated SS (CSS) ({\O} =4.0 mm, {\O} empty core =2.6 mm). 3D artifact models were reconstructed using adaptive thresholding. The artifact size was measured by calculating the perpendicular distance from the central screw axis to the boundary of the artifact in four anatomical directions with respect to the distal tibia. The artifact sizes (in the order of TA, SS, CTA and CSS) from CT were 2.0, 2.6, 1.6 and 2.0 mm; from 1.5T MRI they were 3.7, 10.9, 2.9, and 9 mm; and 3T MRI they were 4.4, 15.3, 3.8, and 11.6 mm respectively. Therefore, CT can be used as long as the screws are at a safe distance of about 2 mm from the articular surface. MRI can be used if the screws are at least 3 mm away from the articular surface except for SS and CSS. Artifacts from steel screws were too large thus obstructed the pilon from being visualised in MRI. Significant differences (P$<$0.05) were found in the size of artifacts between all imaging modalities, screw types and material types, except 1.5T versus 3T MRI for the SS screws (P=0.063). CTA screws near the joint surface can improve postoperative assessment in CT and MRI. MRI presents a favourable non-ionising alternative when using titanium hardware. Since these factors may influence the quality of postoperative assessment, potential improvements in operative techniques should be considered.},

This study aims to quantify the artifact size from orthopaedic screws using CT, 1.5T and 3T MRI data. Three screws were inserted into one intact human cadaver ankle specimen proximal to and along the distal articular surface, then CT, 1.5T and 3T MRI scanned. Four types of screws were investigated: titanium alloy (TA), stainless steel (SS) ({\O} =3.5 mm), cannulated TA (CTA) and cannulated SS (CSS) ({\O} =4.0 mm, {\O} empty core =2.6 mm). 3D artifact models were reconstructed using adaptive thresholding. The artifact size was measured by calculating the perpendicular distance from the central screw axis to the boundary of the artifact in four anatomical directions with respect to the distal tibia. The artifact sizes (in the order of TA, SS, CTA and CSS) from CT were 2.0, 2.6, 1.6 and 2.0 mm; from 1.5T MRI they were 3.7, 10.9, 2.9, and 9 mm; and 3T MRI they were 4.4, 15.3, 3.8, and 11.6 mm respectively. Therefore, CT can be used as long as the screws are at a safe distance of about 2 mm from the articular surface. MRI can be used if the screws are at least 3 mm away from the articular surface except for SS and CSS. Artifacts from steel screws were too large thus obstructed the pilon from being visualised in MRI. Significant differences (P$<$0.05) were found in the size of artifacts between all imaging modalities, screw types and material types, except 1.5T versus 3T MRI for the SS screws (P=0.063). CTA screws near the joint surface can improve postoperative assessment in CT and MRI. MRI presents a favourable non-ionising alternative when using titanium hardware. Since these factors may influence the quality of postoperative assessment, potential improvements in operative techniques should be considered.},

The goal was to provide a framework for biopsy approach and imaging technique parameter selection that will ensure the safety and accuracy of MR-guided procedures.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight titanium and stainless steel alloy MR-compatible biopsy devices were immersed in fluid phantoms and placed into 1.5- and 0.2-T MR systems used for clinical imaging. Spin-echo, turbo spin-echo, and gradient-echo images were obtained with the needle shafts of the biopsy devices placed parallel to, perpendicular to, and at angles of 30 degrees and 60 degrees relative to the static magnetic field of the scanner. All images were obtained with the frequency-encoding direction parallel to and perpendicular to the needle shaft. Needle width and tip position were measured from images on a freestanding workstation, and the apparent tip position was compared with that obtained by direct measurement. The difference between these values was calculated for each needle type, imaging sequence, frequency-encoding direction, and needle orientation.
RESULTS: Artifactual widening was much more apparent at 1.5 T than at 0.2 T, as was error in determining needle tip position. Artifacts at both field strengths were most pronounced with gradient-echo sequences, less so with turbo spin-echo sequences, and least of all with spin-echo sequences. For spin-echo and turbo spin-echo sequences, when the frequency-encoding axis was perpendicular to the needle shaft, the apparent width of the needle was larger, but error in needle tip position was smaller. Artifacts were much less apparent, but error in tip position increased, as the orientation of the needle shaft became more parallel to the direction of the magnetic field.
CONCLUSION: Specific measurements differed with field strength, but needle tip localization within 1 mm was obtained at both 0.2 and 1.5 T with the appropriate frequency-encoding direction, pulse sequence, and imaging parameters. Orientation of the needle parallel to the magnetic field significantly reduced the apparent width of the needle at both field strengths but also decreased the accuracy of needle tip position localization.},

In the past few years several attempts have been made to aid in the understanding of susceptibility artifacts by means of simulation studies. Although these studies, which were mostly carried out with simple test objects, have produced some qualitative insight into $\chi$-artifacts, the results lacked precision in describing finer details. In this paper we show the discrepancy between theory and experiment in previous work to be the result of an inadequate theoretical approach. In most studies so far, $\Delta$B0 effects are taken into account in the frequency domain, that is, after Fourier transformation of the data. In our view the simulation should follow the actual sequence of events in an imaging experiment and deal with the effect of error fields in the time domain (k-space) already. The correctness of this view is demonstrated here by comparing the results of time and frequency domain simulation against experimental observation for a coaxial cylinder phantom, a widely used model in this type of work. Having established the superiority of the time domain simulation, we demonstrate its use in predicting $\chi$-artifacts under various experimental conditions, for example, in spin-echo and gradient-echo imaging with a reduced number of phaseencoding steps.},

  abstract = {Purpose

To accelerate simulation of off-resonance artifacts in steady-state gradient echo MRI by using fast Fourier transforms and demonstrate its applicability to metal object localization.

Theory and Methods

By exploiting the repetitive nature of steady-state pulse sequences it is possible to use fast Fourier transforms to calculate the MR signal. Based on this principle, a method for fast simulation of off-resonance artifacts was designed. The method was validated against Bloch simulations and MRI scans. Its clinical relevance was demonstrated by employing it for template matching-based metal object localization, as applied to a titanium cylinder, an oxidized zirconium knee implant, and gold fiducials.

Results

The fast simulations were accurate compared with actual MRI scans of the objects. The differences between the fast simulations and Bloch simulations were minor, while the acceleration scaled linearly with the number of phase-encoding lines. The object localization method accurately localized the various metal objects.

Conclusion

The proposed simulation methodology provided accurate 3D simulations of off-resonance artifacts with a lower computational complexity than Bloch simulations. The speed of the simulations opens up possibilities in image reconstructions involving off-resonance phenomena that were previously infeasible due to computational limitations, as demonstrated for metal object localization.

  abstract = {An MR-only radiotherapy planning (RTP) workflow would reduce the cost, radiation exposure and uncertainties introduced by CT-MRI registrations. In the case of prostate treatment, one of the remaining challenges currently holding back the implementation of an RTP workflow is the MR-based localisation of intraprostatic gold fiducial markers (FMs), which is crucial for accurate patient positioning. Currently, MR-based FM localisation is clinically performed manually. This is sub-optimal, as manual interaction increases the workload. Attempts to perform automatic FM detection often rely on being able to detect signal voids induced by the FMs in magnitude images. However, signal voids may not always be sufficiently specific, hampering accurate and robust automatic FM localisation. Here, we present an approach that aims at automatic MR-based FM localisation. This method is based on template matching using a library of simulated complex-valued templates, and exploiting the behaviour of the complex MR signal in the vicinity of the FM. Clinical evaluation was performed on seventeen prostate cancer patients undergoing external beam radiotherapy treatment. Automatic MR-based FM localisation was compared to manual MR-based and semi-automatic CT-based localisation (the current gold standard) in terms of detection rate and the spatial accuracy and precision of localisation. The proposed method correctly detected all three FMs in 15/17 patients. The spatial accuracy (mean) and precision (STD) were 0.9 mm and 0.5 mm respectively, which is below the voxel size of \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/0031-9155/62/20/7981/pmbaa875fieqn001.gif] \$1.1 $\backslash$times 1.1 $\backslash$times 1.2\$ mm 3 and comparable to MR-based manual localisation. FM localisation failed (3/51 FMs) in the presence of bleeding or calcifications in the direct vicinity of the FM. The method was found to be spatially accurate and precise, which is essential for clinical use. To overcome any missed detection, we envision the use of the proposed method along with verification by an observer. This will result in a semi-automatic workflow facilitating the introduction of an MR-only workflow.},

  abstract = {Purpose:

The feasibility of radiation therapy treatment planning using substitute computed tomography (sCT) generated from magnetic resonance images (MRIs) has been demonstrated by a number of research groups. One challenge with an MRI-alone workflow is the accurate identification of intraprostatic gold fiducial markers, which are frequently used for prostate localization prior to each dose delivery fraction. This paper investigates a template-matching approach for the detection of these seeds in MRI.

Methods:

Two different gradient echo T1 and T2* weighted MRI sequences were acquired from fifteen prostate cancer patients and evaluated for seed detection. For training, seed templates from manual contours were selected in a spectral clustering manifold learning framework. This aids in clustering ``similar'' gold fiducial markers together. The marker with the minimum distance to a cluster centroid was selected as the representative template of that cluster during training. During testing, Gaussian mixture modeling followed by a Markovian model was used in automatic detection of the probable candidates. The probable candidates were rigidly registered to the templates identified from spectral clustering, and a similarity metric is computed for ranking and detection.

Results:

A fiducial detection accuracy of 95\% was obtained compared to manual observations. Expert radiation therapist observers were able to correctly identify all three implanted seeds on 11 of the 15 scans (the proposed method correctly identified all seeds on 10 of the 15).

Conclusions:

An novel automatic framework for gold fiducial marker detection in MRI is proposed and evaluated with detection accuracies comparable to manual detection. When radiation therapists are unable to determine the seed location in MRI, they refer back to the planning CT (only available in the existing clinical framework); similarly, an automatic quality control is built into the automatic software to ensure that all gold seeds are either correctly detected or a warning is raised for further manual intervention.},

Here we evaluate a model for marker detection in prostate cancer patients by combining information from our hospital standard multi-parametric (mp-) MRI protocol (T1-weighted \textendash{} T1w, T2-weighted \textendash{} T2w, B0) with dedicated sequences (balanced steady-state free precession sequence \textendash{} bTFE, susceptibility weighted imaging \textendash{} SWI). Thirty two patients scheduled for external-beam radiotherapy received a mp-MRI and computed-tomography; the latter was used as ground truth location of the markers. A logistic regression model was implemented for marker detection by combining features from all imaging sequences. The performance of the individual and combined sequences was assessed by determining true and false positive detections. The combination of different sequences (mp-MRI) resulted in a better performance than the best imaging sequence alone (bTFE). Combining mp-MRI+bTFE resulted in good accuracy and a true positive detection rate of 0.94. The standard mp-MRI provides valuable information to detect fiducial markers. The combination of different sequences outperforms the use of a single dedicated sequence. We recommend the addition of a bTFE to the standard mp-MRI protocol to improve fiducial marker detection.},

In this letter, we first perform an analysis of the ME anatomy and use a computational design optimization platform to derive the kinematic requirements for endoscopic inspection of the ME through the Eustachian tube. Based on these requirements, we fabricate the proposed device and use it to demonstrate the feasibility of ME inspection in an anthropomorphic model, i.e., a 3-D printed ME phantom generated from patient image data. We show that our prototype provides $>$ 74\% visibility coverage of the sinus tympani, a region of the ME crucial for diagnosis, compared to an average of only 6.9\% using a straight nonarticulated endoscope through the Eustachian tube.},

  abstract = {Segmentation of interstitial catheters from MRI needs to be addressed in order for MRI-based brachytherapy treatment planning to become part of the clinical practice of gynecologic cancer radiotherapy. This paper presents a validation study of a novel image-processing method for catheter segmentation. The method extends the distal catheter tip, interactively provided by the physician, to its proximal end, using knowledge of catheter geometry and appearance in MRI sequences. The validation study consisted of comparison of the algorithm results to expert manual segmentations, first on images of a phantom, and then on patient MRI images obtained during MRI-guided insertion of brachytherapy catheters for the treatment of gynecologic cancer. In the phantom experiment, the maximum disagreement between automatic and manual segmentation of the same MRI image, as computed using the Hausdorf distance, was 1.5 mm, which is of the same order as the MR image spatial resolution, while the disagreement between automatic segmentation of MR images and ``ground truth'', manual segmentation of CT images, was 3.5mm. The segmentation method was applied to an IRB-approved retrospective database of 10 interstitial brachytherapy patients which included a total of 101 catheters. Compared with manual expert segmentations, the automatic method correctly segmented 93 out of 101 catheters, at an average rate of 0.3 seconds per catheter using a 3GHz Intel Core i7 computer with 16 GB RAM and running Mac OS X 10.7. These results suggest that the proposed catheter segmentation is both technically and clinically feasible.},

  abstract = {Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is widely used in routine clinical diagnosis and treatment. However, variations in MRI acquisition protocols result in different appearances of normal and diseased tissue in the images. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which have shown to be successful in many medical image analysis tasks, are typically sensitive to the variations in imaging protocols. Therefore, in many cases, networks trained on data acquired with one MRI protocol, do not perform satisfactorily on data acquired with different protocols. This limits the use of models trained with large annotated legacy datasets on a new dataset with a different domain which is often a recurring situation in clinical settings. In this study, we aim to answer the following central questions regarding domain adaptation in medical image analysis: Given a fitted legacy model, 1) How much data from the new domain is required for a decent adaptation of the original network?; and, 2) What portion of the pre-trained model parameters should be retrained given a certain number of the new domain training samples? To address these questions, we conducted extensive experiments in white matter hyperintensity segmentation task. We trained a CNN on legacy MR images of brain and evaluated the performance of the domain-adapted network on the same task with images from a different domain. We then compared the performance of the model to the surrogate scenarios where either the same trained network is used or a new network is trained from scratch on the new dataset.The domain-adapted network tuned only by two training examples achieved a Dice score of 0.63 substantially outperforming a similar network trained on the same set of examples from scratch.},

Building upon the previously proposed PatchMatch stereo and PM-Huber algorithm we introduce an extension to the multi-view scenario that employs an iterative refinement scheme. Our proposed approach uses an extended and robustified volumetric truncated signed distance function representation, which is advantageous for the fusion of refined depth maps and also for raycasting the current reconstruction estimation together with estimated depth normals into arbitrary camera views. We formulate the combined multi-view stereo reconstruction and refinement as a variational optimization problem. The newly introduced plane based smoothing term in the energy formulation is guided by the current reconstruction confidence and the image contents. Further we propose an extension of the PatchMatch scheme with an additional KLT step to avoid unnecessary sampling iterations. Improper camera poses are corrected by a direct image aligment step that performs robust outlier compensation by means of a recently proposed kernel lifting framework. To speed up the optimization of the variational formulation an adapted scheme is used for faster convergence.},

  abstract = {Accurate 3d perception from video sequences is a core subject in computer vision and robotics, since it forms the basis of subsequent scene analysis. In practice however, online requirements often severely limit the utilizable camera resolution and hence also reconstruction accuracy. Furthermore, real-time systems often rely on heavy parallelism which can prevent applications in mobile devices or driver assistance systems, especially in cases where FPGAs cannot be employed. This paper proposes a novel approach to build 3d maps from high-resolution stereo sequences in real-time. Inspired by recent progress in stereo matching, we propose a sparse feature matcher in conjunction with an efficient and robust visual odometry algorithm. Our reconstruction pipeline combines both techniques with efficient stereo matching and a multi-view linking scheme for generating consistent 3d point clouds. In our experiments we show that the proposed odometry method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. Including feature matching, the visual odometry part of our algorithm runs at 25 frames per second, while - at the same time - we obtain new depth maps at 3-4 fps, sufficient for online 3d reconstructions.},

  abstract = {Real-time, high-quality, 3D scanning of large-scale scenes is key to mixed reality and robotic applications. However, scalability brings challenges of drift in pose estimation, introducing significant errors in the accumulated model. Approaches often require hours of offline processing to globally correct model errors. Recent online methods demonstrate compelling results but suffer from (1) needing minutes to perform online correction, preventing true real-time use; (2) brittle frame-to-frame (or frame-to-model) pose estimation, resulting in many tracking failures; or (3) supporting only unstructured point-based representations, which limit scan quality and applicability. We systematically address these issues with a novel, real-time, end-to-end reconstruction framework. At its core is a robust pose estimation strategy, optimizing per frame for a global set of camera poses by considering the complete history of RGB-D input with an efficient hierarchical approach. We remove the heavy reliance on temporal tracking and continually localize to the globally optimized frames instead. We contribute a parallelizable optimization framework, which employs correspondences based on sparse features and dense geometric and photometric matching. Our approach estimates globally optimized (i.e., bundle adjusted) poses in real time, supports robust tracking with recovery from gross tracking failures (i.e., relocalization), and re-estimates the 3D model in real time to ensure global consistency, all within a single framework. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art online systems with quality on par to offline methods, but with unprecedented speed and scan completeness. Our framework leads to a comprehensive online scanning solution for large indoor environments, enabling ease of use and high-quality results.1},

  volume = {44},
  issn = {2473-4209},
  doi = {10.1002/mp.12505},
  abstract = {Purpose

An MR-only postimplant dosimetry workflow for low dose rate (LDR) brachytherapy could reduce patient burden, improve accuracy, and improve cost efficiency. However, localization of brachytherapy seeds on MRI scans remains a major challenge for this type of workflow. In this study, we propose and validate an MR-only seed localization method and identify remaining challenges.

Methods and materials

The localization method was based on template matching of simulations of complex-valued imaging artifacts around metal brachytherapy seeds. The method was applied to MRI scans of 25 prostate cancer patients who underwent LDR brachytherapy and for whom postimplant dosimetry was performed after 4 weeks. The seed locations found with the MR-only method were validated against the seed locations found on CT. The circumstances in which detection errors were made were classified to gain an insight in the nature of the errors.

Results

A total of 1490 of 1557 (96\%) seeds were correctly detected, while 67 false-positive errors were made. The correctly detected seed locations had a high spatial accuracy with an average error of 0.8 mm compared with CT. A majority of the false positives occurred near other seeds. Most false negatives were found in either stranded configurations without spacers or near other seeds.

Conclusions

The low detection error rate and high localization accuracy obtained by the complex-valued template matching approach are promising for future clinical application of MR-only dosimetry. The most important remaining challenge is robustness with regard to configurations of multiple seeds in close vicinity, such as in strands of seeds without spacers. This issue could potentially be resolved by simulating specific configurations of multiple seeds or by constraining the treatment planning to avoid these configurations, which could make the proposed method competitive with CT-based seed localization.},

  abstract = {Purpose

An MR-only postimplant dosimetry workflow for low dose rate (LDR) brachytherapy could reduce patient burden, improve accuracy, and improve cost efficiency. However, localization of brachytherapy seeds on MRI scans remains a major challenge for this type of workflow. In this study, we propose and validate an MR-only seed localization method and identify remaining challenges.

Methods and materials

The localization method was based on template matching of simulations of complex-valued imaging artifacts around metal brachytherapy seeds. The method was applied to MRI scans of 25 prostate cancer patients who underwent LDR brachytherapy and for whom postimplant dosimetry was performed after 4 weeks. The seed locations found with the MR-only method were validated against the seed locations found on CT. The circumstances in which detection errors were made were classified to gain an insight in the nature of the errors.

Results

A total of 1490 of 1557 (96\%) seeds were correctly detected, while 67 false-positive errors were made. The correctly detected seed locations had a high spatial accuracy with an average error of 0.8 mm compared with CT. A majority of the false positives occurred near other seeds. Most false negatives were found in either stranded configurations without spacers or near other seeds.

Conclusions

The low detection error rate and high localization accuracy obtained by the complex-valued template matching approach are promising for future clinical application of MR-only dosimetry. The most important remaining challenge is robustness with regard to configurations of multiple seeds in close vicinity, such as in strands of seeds without spacers. This issue could potentially be resolved by simulating specific configurations of multiple seeds or by constraining the treatment planning to avoid these configurations, which could make the proposed method competitive with CT-based seed localization.},

  abstract = {MRI-guided prostate biopsy in conventional closed-bore scanners requires transferring the patient outside the bore during needle insertion due to the constrained in-bore space, causing a safety hazard and limiting image feedback. To address this issue, we present our custom-made in-bore setup and software to support MRI-guided transperineal prostate biopsy in a wide-bore 3 Tesla (T) MRI scanner. The setup consists of a specially designed tabletop and a needle-guiding template with Z-frame that give a physician access to the perineum of the patient at the imaging position and allow performance of MRI-guided transperineal biopsy without moving the patient out of the scanner. The software and Z-frame allow registration of the template, target planning, and biopsy guidance. Initially, we performed phantom experiments to assess the accuracy of template registration and needle placement in a controlled environment. Subsequently, we embarked on our clinical trial (N = 10). The phantom experiments showed that the translational errors of the template registration along the right-left (RP) and anterior-posterior (AP) axes were 1.1 $\pm$ 0.8 mm and 1.4 $\pm$ 1.1 mm respectively, while the rotational errors around the RL, AP, and superior-inferior axes were 0.8 $\pm$ 1.0 degrees, 1.7 $\pm$ 1.6 degrees, and 0.0 $\pm$ 0.0 degrees respectively. The 2D root-mean-square (RMS) needle placement error was 3.0 mm. The clinical biopsy procedures were safely carried out in all ten clinical cases with a needle placement error of 5.4 mm (2D RMS). In conclusion, transperineal prostate biopsy in a wide-bore 3T scanner is feasible using our custom-made tabletop set up and software, which supports manual needle placement without moving the patient out of the magnet.},

  abstract = {Purpose
To develop and evaluate image registration methodology for automated re-identification of tumor-suspicious foci from pre-procedural MR exams during MR-guided transperineal prostate core biopsy.

Materials and Methods
A hierarchical approach for automated registration between planning and intra-procedural T2-weighted prostate MRI was developed and evaluated on the images acquired during 10 consecutive MR-guided biopsies. Registration accuracy was quantified at image-based landmarks and by evaluating spatial overlap for the manually segmented prostate and sub-structures. Registration reliability was evaluated by simulating initial mis-registration and analyzing the convergence behavior. Registration precision was characterized at the planned biopsy targets.

Results
The total computation time was compatible with a clinical setting, being at most 2 minutes. Deformable registration led to a significant improvement in spatial overlap of the prostate and peripheral zone contours compared to both rigid and affine registration. Average in-slice landmark registration error was 1.3$\pm$0.5 mm. Experiments simulating initial mis-registration resulted in an estimated average capture range of 6 mm and an average in-slice registration precision of $\pm$0.3 mm.

Conclusion
Our registration approach requires minimum user interaction and is compatible with the time constraints of our interventional clinical workflow. The initial evaluation shows acceptable accuracy, reliability and consistency of the method.},

In much previous work on grasping, the object being grasped is assumed to be the only object in the environment. Hence the grasp quality metrics and grasping strategies developed do not perform well when the object is close to obstacles and many good grasps are infeasible. We introduce a framework for finding valid grasps in cluttered environments that combines a grasp quality metric for the object with information about the local environment around the object and information about the robot's kinematics. We encode these factors in a grasp-scoring function which we use to rank a precomputed set of grasps in terms of their appropriateness for a given scene. We show that this ranking is essential for efficient grasp selection and present experiments in simulation and on the HRP2 robot.},

  abstract = {Reach-to-grasp arm postures differ from those in pure reaching because they are affected by grasp position/orientation, rather than simple transport to a position during a reaching motion. This paper investigates this difference via an analysis of experimental data collected on reaching and reach-to-grasp motions. A seven-degree-of-freedom (DOFs) kinematic arm model with the swivel angle is used for the motion analysis. Compared to a widely used anatomical arm model, this model distinguishes clearly the four grasping-relevant DOFs (GR-DOFs) that are affected by positions and orientations of the objects to be grasped. These four GR-DOFs include the swivel angle that measures the elbow rotation about the shoulder\textendash{}wrist axis, and three wrist joint angles. For each GR-DOF, we quantify position vs orientation task-relevance bias that measures how much the DOF is affected by the grasping position vs orientation. The swivel angle and forearm supination have similar bias, and the analysis of their motion suggests two hypotheses regarding the synergistic coordination of the macro- and micro-structures of the human arm (1) DOFs with similar task-relevance are synergistically coordinated; and (2) such synergy breaks when a task-relevant DOF is close to its joint limit without necessarily reaching the limit. This study provides a motion analysis method to reduce the control complexity for reach-to-grasp tasks, and suggests using dynamic coupling to coordinate the hand and arm of upper-limb exoskeletons.},

By limiting the search for edges to these areas a significant amount of computation time is saved compared to searching the entire image. Pixels belonging to both the depth and colour edges of an RGB-D image can be back projected using the depth component to form 3D point clouds of edge points.

  abstract = {Future humanoid robots will be expected to carry out a wide range of tasks for which they had not been originally equipped by learning new skills and adapting to their environment. A crucial requirement towards that goal is to be able to take advantage of external elements as tools to perform tasks for which their own manipulators are insufficient; the ability to autonomously learn how to use tools will render robots far more versatile and simpler to design. Motivated by this prospect, this paper proposes and evaluates an approach to allow robots to learn tool affordances based on their 3D geometry. To this end, we apply tool-pose descriptors to represent tools combined with the way in which they are grasped, and affordance vectors to represent the effect tool-poses achieve in function of the action performed. This way, tool affordance learning consists in determining the mapping between these 2 representations, which is achieved in 2 steps. First, the dimensionality of both representations is reduced by unsupervisedly mapping them onto respective Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs). Then, the mapping between the neurons in the tool-pose SOM and the neurons in the affordance SOM for pairs of tool-poses and their corresponding affordance vectors, respectively, is learned with a neural based regression model. This method enables the robot to accurately predict the effect of its actions using tools, and thus to select the best action for a given goal, even with tools not seen on the learning phase.},

In practical applications for robotic manipulation, the representation of collision and collision-free regions in configuration space can change due to relative motion between the robot base and workspace. We show how to rapidly adapt to such changes by using inverse kinematics to transform the parameters of the Gaussian mixture model to new configurations. The transformed model is initially used as a prior and then continually updated and refined as the RRT planning algorithm proceeds in real-time. This approach is extremely computationally efficient, and our proposed method is compared with traditional sampling-based planning methods on a number of experimental robot arm planning scenarios.},

The integration of the vision system in the generation of the robot program overcomes the current problems related to AOLP systems that rely on a known model of the work environment. This enables the ability to dynamically adapt the model according to sensor data, thus coping with environmental and parts variability during operation.

Given a RGB-D video, we jointly model the human activities and object affordances as a Markov random field where the nodes represent objects and sub-activities, and the edges represent the relationships between object affordances, their relations with sub-activities, and their evolution over time. We formulate the learning problem using a structural support vector machine (SSVM) approach, where labelings over various alternate temporal segmentations are considered as latent variables. We tested our method on a challenging dataset comprising 120 activity videos collected from 4 subjects, and obtained an accuracy of 79.4\% for affordance, 63.4\% for sub-activity and 75.0\% for high-level activity labeling. We then demonstrate the use of such descriptive labeling in performing assistive tasks by a PR2 robot.},

  abstract = {An autonomous robot should be able to evaluate the affordances that are offered by a given situation. Here we address this problem by designing a system that can densely predict affordances given only a single 2D RGB image. This is achieved with a convolutional neural network (ResNet), which we combine with refinement modules recently proposed for addressing semantic image segmentation. We define a novel cost function, which is able to handle (potentially multiple) affordances of objects and their parts in a pixel-wise manner even in the case of incomplete data. We perform qualitative as well as quantitative evaluations with simulated and real data assessing 15 different affordances. In general, we find that affordances, which are well-enough represented in the training data, are correctly recognized with a substantial fraction of correctly assigned pixels. Furthermore, we show that our model outperforms several baselines. Hence, this method can give clear action guidelines for a robot.},

By reparametrising the configuration space to match the course of the road, it can be sampled very economically with few vertices, and this reduces absolute runtime further. The trajectories generated are quintic splines. They are second order continuous, obey nonholonomic constraints and are optimised for minimum square of jerk.

For robots with several degrees of freedom, collision checks are computationally expensive and often dominate planning time. Our goal is to minimize the number of collision checks for obtaining the first feasible path and successively shorter feasible paths. We assume that the roadmaps we search over are embedded in a continuous ambient space, where nearby points tend to share the same collision state. This enables us to formulate a probabilistic model that computes the probability of unevaluated configurations being collision-free. We update the model over time as more checks are performed. This model lets us define a weighting function for roadmap edges that is related to the probability of the edge being in collision. Our approach is to trade off between these two weights, gradually prioritizing edge length over collision likelihood. We also show that this tradeoff is approximately equivalent to minimizing the expected path length, with a penalty of being in collision. Our experiments demonstrate that POMP performs comparably with RRTConnect and LazyPRM for the first feasible path, and BIT* for anytime performance, both in terms of collision checks and total planning time.},

Given a start state and a goal state for each of the agents, the task is to find minimal paths for the different agents while avoiding collisions. Previous work on solving this problem optimally, used traditional single-agent search variants of the A* algorithm. We present a novel formalization for this problem which includes a search tree called the increasing cost tree (ICT) and a corresponding search algorithm, called the increasing cost tree search (ICTS) that finds optimal solutions. ICTS is a two-level search algorithm. The high-level phase of ICTS searches the increasing cost tree for a set of costs (cost per agent). The low-level phase of ICTS searches for a valid path for every agent that is constrained to have the same cost as given by the high-level phase. We analyze this new formalization, compare it to the A* search formalization and provide the pros and cons of each. Following, we show how the unique formalization of ICTS allows even further pruning of the state space by grouping small sets of agents and identifying unsolvable combinations of costs. Experimental results on various domains show the benefits and limitations of our new approach. A speedup of up to 3 orders of magnitude was obtained in some cases.},

In addition, it exhibits highly dynamic behavior that allows it to perform on par with methods like limited discrepancy search and frequent restarting in terms of quickly finding good solutions.We also use the lower bounds reported by HBFS in problems with small treewidth, by integrating it into Backtracking with Tree Decomposition (BTD). BTD-HBFS exploits the lower bounds reported by HBFS in individual clusters to improve the anytime behavior and global pruning lower bound of BTD.In an extensive empirical evaluation on optimization problems from a variety of application domains, we show that both HBFS and BTD-HBFS improve both anytime and overall performance compared to their counterparts.},

However, little effort has been devoted to the formal analysis of the quality of the solution returned by such algorithms, e.g. as a function of the number of samples. The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap, by rigorously analyzing the asymptotic behavior of the cost of the solution returned by stochastic sampling-based algorithms as the number of samples increases. A number of negative results are provided, characterizing existing algorithms, e.g. showing that, under mild technical conditions, the cost of the solution returned by broadly used sampling-based algorithms converges almost surely to a non-optimal value. The main contribution of the paper is the introduction of new algorithms, namely, PRM* and RRT*, which are provably asymptotically optimal, i.e. such that the cost of the returned solution converges almost surely to the optimum. Moreover, it is shown that the computational complexity of the new algorithms is within a constant factor of that of their probabilistically complete (but not asymptotically optimal) counterparts. The analysis in this paper hinges on novel connections between stochastic sampling-based path planning algorithms and the theory of random geometric graphs.},

  abstract = {Agents operating in the real world often have limited time available for planning their next actions. Producing optimal plans is infeasible in these scenarios. Instead, agents must be satisfied with the best plans they can generate within the time available. One class of planners well-suited to this task are anytime planners, which quickly find an initial, highly suboptimal plan, and then improve this plan until time runs out. A second challenge associated with planning in the real world is that models are usually imperfect and environments are often dynamic. Thus, agents need to update their models and consequently plans over time. Incremental planners, which make use of the results of previous planning efforts to generate a new plan, can substantially speed up each planning episode in such cases. In this paper, we present an A${_\ast}$-based anytime search algorithm that produces significantly better solutions than current approaches, while also providing suboptimality bounds on the quality of the solution at any point in time. We also present an extension of this algorithm that is both anytime and incremental. This extension improves its current solution while deliberation time allows and is able to incrementally repair its solution when changes to the world model occur. We provide a number of theoretical and experimental results and demonstrate the effectiveness of the approaches in a robot navigation domain involving two physical systems. We believe that the simplicity, theoretical properties, and generality of the presented methods make them well suited to a range of search problems involving dynamic graphs.},

Unlike previous proposals, it successfully combines estimates of solution length and solution cost to predict which node will lead most quickly to a solution within the suboptimality bound. An empirical evaluation across six diverse benchmark domains shows that Explicit Estimation Search is competitive with the previous state of the art in domains with unit-cost actions and substantially outperforms previously proposed techniques for domains in which solution cost and length can differ.},

  abstract = {Purpose:
This work describes the characterization and evaluation of a tissue-mimicking thermochromic phantom (TMTCP) for direct visualization and quantitative determination of temperatures during radiofrequency ablation (RFA).

Methods:
TMTCP material was prepared using polyacrylamide gel and thermochromic ink that permanently changes color from white to magenta when heated. Color vs temperature calibration was generated in matlab by extracting RGB color values from digital photographs of phantom standards heated in a water bath at 25\textendash{}75\,$^\circ$C. RGB and temperature values were plotted prior to curve fitting in mathematica using logistic functions of form f(t) = a + b/(1 + e(c(t-d))), where a, b, c, and d are coefficients and t denotes temperature. To quantify temperatures based on TMTCP color, phantom samples were heated to temperatures blinded to the investigators, and two methods were evaluated: (1) visual comparison of sample color to the calibration series and (2) in silico analysis using the inverse of the logistic functions to convert sample photograph RGB values to absolute temperatures. For evaluation of TMTCP performance with RFA, temperatures in phantom samples and in a bovine liver were measured radially from an RF electrode during heating using fiber-optic temperature probes. Heating and cooling rates as well as the area under the temperature vs time curves were compared. Finally, temperature isotherms were generated computationally based on color change in bisected phantoms following RFA and compared to temperature probe measurements.

Results:
TMTCP heating resulted in incremental, permanent color changes between 40 and 64\,$^\circ$C. Visual and computational temperature estimation methods were accurate to within 1.4 and 1.9\,$^\circ$C between 48 and 67\,$^\circ$C, respectively. Temperature estimates were most accurate between 52 and 62\,$^\circ$C, resulting in differences from actual temperatures of 0.6 and 1.6\,$^\circ$C for visual and computational methods, respectively. Temperature measurements during RFA using fiber-optic probes matched closely with maximum temperatures predicted by color changes in the TMTCP. Heating rate and cooling rate, as well as the area under the temperature vs time curve were similar for TMTCP and ex vivo liver.

Conclusions:
The TMTCP formulated for use with RFA can be used to provide quantitative temperature information in mild hyperthermic (40\textendash{}45\,$^\circ$C), subablative (45\textendash{}50\,$^\circ$C), and ablative ($>$50\,$^\circ$C) temperature ranges. Accurate visual or computational estimates of absolute temperatures and ablation zone geometry can be made with high spatial resolution based on TMTCP color. As such, the TMTCP can be used to assess RFA heating characteristics in a controlled, predictable environment.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a robotic pick-and-place system that is capable of grasping and recognizing both known and novel objects in cluttered environments. The key new feature of the system is that it handles a wide range of object categories without needing any task-specific training data for novel objects. To achieve this, it first uses a category-agnostic affordance prediction algorithm to select among four different grasping primitive behaviors. It then recognizes picked objects with a cross-domain image classification framework that matches observed images to product images. Since product images are readily available for a wide range of objects (e.g., from the web), the system works out-of-the-box for novel objects without requiring any additional training data. Exhaustive experimental results demonstrate that our multi-affordance grasping achieves high success rates for a wide variety of objects in clutter, and our recognition algorithm achieves high accuracy for both known and novel grasped objects. The approach was part of the MIT-Princeton Team system that took 1st place in the stowing task at the 2017 Amazon Robotics Challenge.

  abstract = {Robot warehouse automation has attracted significant interest in recent years, perhaps most visibly in the Amazon Picking Challenge (APC). A fully autonomous warehouse pick-and-place system requires robust vision that reliably recognizes and locates objects amid cluttered environments, self-occlusions, sensor noise, and a large variety of objects. In this paper we present an approach that leverages multi-view RGB-D data and self-supervised, data-driven learning to overcome those difficulties. The approach was part of the MIT-Princeton Team system that took 3rd- and 4th- place in the stowing and picking tasks, respectively at APC 2016. In the proposed approach, we segment and label multiple views of a scene with a fully convolutional neural network, and then fit pre-scanned 3D object models to the resulting segmentation to get the 6D object pose. Training a deep neural network for segmentation typically requires a large amount of training data. We propose a self-supervised method to generate a large labeled dataset without tedious manual segmentation. We demonstrate that our system can reliably estimate the 6D pose of objects under a variety of scenarios. All code, data, and benchmarks are available at http://apc.cs.princeton.edu/},

The input to our algorithm is a point cloud and the geometric parameters of the robot hand. The output is a set of hand configurations that are expected to be good grasps. Our key idea is to use knowledge of the geometry of a good grasp to improve detection. First, we use a geometrically necessary condition to sample a large set of high quality grasp hypotheses. We were surprised to find that using simple geometric conditions for detection can result in a relatively high grasp success rate. Second, we use the notion of an antipodal grasp (a standard characterization of a good two fingered grasp) to help us classify these grasp hypotheses. In particular, we generate a large automatically labeled training set that gives us high classification accuracy. Overall, our method achieves an average grasp success rate of 88\% when grasping novels objects presented in isolation and an average success rate of 73\% when grasping novel objects presented in dense clutter.

  abstract = {We present a practical vision-based robotic bin-picking system that performs detection and three-dimensional pose estimation of objects in an unstructured bin using a novel camera design, picks up parts from the bin, and performs error detection and pose correction while the part is in the gripper. Two main innovations enable our system to achieve real-time robust and accurate operation. First, we use a multi-flash camera that extracts robust depth edges. Second, we introduce an efficient shape-matching algorithm called fast directional chamfer matching (FDCM), which is used to reliably detect objects and estimate their poses. FDCM improves the accuracy of chamfer matching by including edge orientation. It also achieves massive improvements in matching speed using line-segment approximations of edges, a three-dimensional distance transform, and directional integral images. We empirically show that these speedups, combined with the use of bounds in the spatial and hypothesis domains, give the algorithm sublinear computational complexity. We also apply our FDCM method to other applications in the context of deformable and articulated shape matching. In addition to significantly improving upon the accuracy of previous chamfer matching methods in all of the evaluated applications, FDCM is up to two orders of magnitude faster than the previous methods.},

  abstract = {The ability of N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM)-based hydrogel phantoms to mimic tissues with different acoustic and thermal properties under high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation was investigated. These phantoms were designed to model the formation of thermal lesions in tissues above the threshold temperature of protein denaturation. By adjusting the concentration of acrylic acid (AAc) in the NIPAM-based hydrogel phantoms, the cloud point (i.e., lower critical solution temperature) of the phantoms could be tailored to produce HIFU thermal lesions similar to those formed in different swine tissues in terms of size and shape. Additionally, energy thresholds for inducing transient or permanent bubbles in the phantoms during HIFU ablation were also identified to shed light on the onset of cavitation or material damage. The NIPAM-based hydrogel phantoms developed in this study possess major advantages such as transparent, reusable and tailorable properties, and are practical tools for characterizing an ablative device (or treatment) to determine its efficacy and safety.},

  doi = {10.1117/12.2254707},
  abstract = {Three dimensional (3D) ultrasound imaging is becoming a standard mode for medical ultrasound diagnoses. Conventional 3D ultrasound imaging is mostly scanned either by using a two dimensional matrix array or by motorizing a one dimensional array in the elevation direction. However, the former system is not widely assessable due to its cost, and the latter one has limited resolution and field-of-view in the elevation axis. Here, we propose a 3D ultrasound imaging system based on the synthetic tracked aperture approach, in which a robotic arm is used to provide accurate tracking and motion. While the ultrasound probe is moved by a robotic arm, each probe position is tracked and can be used to reconstruct a wider field-of-view as there are no physical barriers that restrict the elevational scanning. At the same time, synthetic aperture beamforming provides a better resolution in the elevation axis. To synthesize the elevational information, the single focal point is regarded as the virtual element, and forward and backward delay-andsum are applied to the radio-frequency (RF) data collected through the volume. The concept is experimentally validated using a general ultrasound phantom, and the elevational resolution improvement of 2.54 and 2.13 times was measured at the target depths of 20 mm and 110 mm, respectively.},

  doi = {10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139369},
  abstract = {As robots begin to collaborate with humans in everyday workspaces, they will need to understand the functions of tools and their parts. To cut an apple or hammer a nail, robots need to not just know the tool's name, but they must localize the tool's parts and identify their functions. Intuitively, the geometry of a part is closely related to its possible functions, or its affordances. Therefore, we propose two approaches for learning affordances from local shape and geometry primitives: 1) superpixel based hierarchical matching pursuit (S-HMP); and 2) structured random forests (SRF). Moreover, since a part can be used in many ways, we introduce a large RGB-Depth dataset where tool parts are labeled with multiple affordances and their relative rankings. With ranked affordances, we evaluate the proposed methods on 3 cluttered scenes and over 105 kitchen, workshop and garden tools, using ranked correlation and a weighted F-measure score [26]. Experimental results over sequences containing clutter, occlusions, and viewpoint changes show that the approaches return precise predictions that could be used by a robot. S-HMP achieves high accuracy but at a significant computational cost, while SRF provides slightly less accurate predictions but in real-time. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our approaches on the Cornell Grasping Dataset [25] for detecting graspable regions, and achieve state-of-the-art performance.},

By structural information we refer to the inherently available, topological distribution of object classes in a given image. Different object class labels will not be randomly distributed over an image but usually form coherently labelled regions. In this work we provide a way to incorporate this topological information in the popular random forest framework for performing low-level, unary classification. Our paper has several contributions: First, we show how random forests can be augmented with structured label information. In the second part, we introduce a novel data splitting function that exploits the joint distributions observed in the structured label space for learning typical label transitions between object classes. Finally, we provide two possibilities for integrating the structured output predictions into concise, semantic labellings. In our experiments on the challenging MSRC and CamVid databases, we compare our method to standard random forest and conditional random field classification results.},

First, we need to evaluate a huge number of candidate grasps. In order to make detection fast and robust, we present a two-step cascaded system with two deep networks, where the top detections from the first are re-evaluated by the second. The first network has fewer features, is faster to run, and can effectively prune out unlikely candidate grasps. The second, with more features, is slower but has to run only on the top few detections. Second, we need to handle multimodal inputs effectively, for which we present a method that applies structured regularization on the weights based on multimodal group regularization. We show that our method improves performance on an RGBD robotic grasping dataset, and can be used to successfully execute grasps on two different robotic platforms.},

Here, we overcome this difficulty by proposing an analog, optical device, that performs the random projections literally at the speed of light without having to store any matrix in memory. This is achieved using the physical properties of multiple coherent scattering of coherent light in random media. We use this device on a simple task of classification with a kernel machine, and we show that, on the MNIST database, the experimental results closely match the theoretical performance of the corresponding kernel. This framework can help make kernel methods practical for applications that have large training sets and/or require real-time prediction.

Steering such needles along curved paths allows one to avoid anatomical obstacles and reach locations inside the human body which are unreachable with rigid needles. In this study, a mechanics-based model is presented which predicts needle deflection for a needle undergoing multiple bends during insertion into soft tissue. The model is based on a Rayleigh-Ritz formulation, and inputs to the model are a force at the needle tip and a distributed load which acts along the needle shaft. Experiments are used to evaluate the distributed load, and needle deflection is then predicted using the model. The results of the model are compared with a kinematics-based model. Maximum errors in final tip deflection are found to be 0.5 mm and 0.6 mm for the mechanics-based and kinematics-based model, respectively. Though both models are found to be comparable, the mechanics-based model can account for deflection when the needle radius of curvature is not constant (e.g., biological tissue).},

In this paper, an image-guided control system is developed to robotically steer flexible needles with an asymmetric tip. Knowledge about needle deflection is required for accurate steering. Two different models to predict needle deflection are presented. The first is a kinematics-based model, and the second model predicts needle deflection that is based on the mechanics of needle-tissue interaction. Both models predict deflection of needles that undergo multiple bends. The maximum targeting errors of the kinematics-based and the mechanics-based models for 110-mm insertion distance using a $\varphi$ 0.5-mm needle are 0.8 and 1.7 mm, respectively. The kinematics-based model is used in the proposed image-guided control system. The control system accounts for target motion during the insertion procedure by detecting the target position in each image frame. Five experimental cases are presented to validate the real-time control system using both camera and ultrasound images as feedback. The experimental results show that the targeting errors of camera and ultrasound image-guided steering toward a moving target are 0.35 and 0.42 mm, respectively.

  doi = {10.1109/ICRA.2013.6630797},
  abstract = {Needle insertion is one of the most commonly performed minimally invasive procedures. Visualization of the needle during insertion is key for either successful diagnosis or therapy. This work presents the real-time three-dimensional tracking of flexible needles during insertion into a soft-tissue simulant using a two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound transducer. The transducer is placed perpendicular to the needle tip to measure its position. During insertion the transducer is robotically repositioned to track the needle tip. Positioning of the transducer is accomplished by a compensator, that uses the needle insertion velocity corrected by needle tip velocities to determine out-of-plane motion. Experiments are performed to validate the needle tip pose during tracking. The maximum mean errors in needle tip position along the x-, y- and z-axes are 0.64 mm, 0.25 mm and 0.27 mm, respectively. The error in tip orientations (\texttheta-about the y-axis and $\varphi$-about the z-axis) are 2.68$^\circ$ and 2.83$^\circ$, respectively. This study demonstrates the ability to compute the needle tip pose using a 2D ultrasound transducer. The tip pose can be used to robotically steer needles, and thereby improve accuracy of medical procedures.},

This enables robotic needle steering, which can be used in medical procedures to reach subsurface targets inaccessible by straight-line trajectories. However, accurate path planning and control of needle steering require models of needle-tissue interaction. Previous kinematic models required empirical observations of each needle and tissue combination in order to fit model parameters. This study describes a mechanics-based model of robotic needle steering, which can be used to predict needle behavior and optimize system design based on fundamental mechanical and geometrical properties of the needle and tissue. We first present an analytical model for the loads developed at the tip, based on the geometry of the bevel edge and material properties of soft-tissue simulants (gels). We then present a mechanics-based model that calculates the deflection of a bevel-tipped needle inserted through a soft elastic medium. The model design is guided by microscopic observations of needle-gel interactions. The energy-based formulation incorporates tissue-specific parameters, and the geometry and material properties of the needle. Simulation results follow similar trends (deflection and radius of curvature) to those observed in experimental studies of robotic needle insertion.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present efficient solutions for planning motions of dual-arm manipulation and re-grasping tasks. Motion planning for such tasks on humanoid robots with a high number of degrees of freedom (DoF) requires computationally efficient approaches to determine the robot's full joint configuration at a given grasping position, i.e. solving the Inverse Kinematics (IK) problem for one or both hands of the robot. In this context, we investigate solving the inverse kinematics problem and motion planning for dual-arm manipulation and re-grasping tasks by combining a gradient-descent approach in the robot's pre-computed reachability space with random sampling of free parameters. This strategy provides feasible IK solutions at a low computation cost without resorting to iterative methods which could be trapped by joint-limits. We apply this strategy to dual-arm motion planning tasks in which the robot is holding an object with one hand in order to generate whole-body robot configurations suitable for grasping the object with both hands. In addition, we present two probabilistically complete RRT-based motion planning algorithms (J+-RRT and IK-RRT) that interleave the search for an IK solution with the search for a collision-free trajectory and the extension of these planners to solving re-grasping problems. The capabilities of combining IK methods and planners are shown both in simulation and on the humanoid robot ARMAR-III performing dual-arm tasks in a kitchen environment.},

  abstract = {Needle insertion procedures are commonly used for surgical interventions. In this paper, we develop a three-dimensional (3D) closed-loop control algorithm to robotically steer flexible needles with an asymmetric tip towards a target in a soft-tissue phantom. Twelve Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors are embedded on the needle shaft. FBG sensors measure the strain applied on the needle during insertion. A method is developed to reconstruct the needle shape using the strain data obtained from the FBG sensors. Four experimental cases are conducted to validate the reconstruction method (single-bend, double-bend, 3D double-bend and drilling insertions). In the experiments, the needle is inserted 120 mm into a soft-tissue phantom. Camera images are used as a reference for the reconstruction experiments. The results show that the mean needle tip accuracy of the reconstruction method is 1.8 mm. The reconstructed needle shape is used as feedback for the steering algorithm. The steering algorithm estimates the region that the needle can reach during insertion, and controls the needle to keep the target in this region. Steering experiments are performed for 110 mm insertion, and the mean targeting accuracy is 1.3 mm. The results demonstrate the capability of using FBG sensors to robotically steer needles.},

Despite its promise, autonomous manipulation remains largely unsolved. Even the most rudimentary manipulation task\textemdash{}such as removing objects from a pile\textemdash{}remains challenging for robots. We identify three major challenges that must be addressed to enable autonomous manipulation: object segmentation, action selection, and motion generation. These challenges become more pronounced when unknown man-made or natural objects are cluttered together in a pile. We present a system capable of manipulating unknown objects in such an environment. Our robot is tasked with clearing a table by removing objects from a pile and placing them into a bin. To that end, we address the three aforementioned challenges. Our robot perceives the environment with an RGB-D sensor, segmenting the pile into object hypotheses using non-parametric surface models. Our system then computes the affordances of each object, and selects the best affordance and its associated action to execute. Finally, our robot instantiates the proper compliant motion primitive to safely execute the desired action. For efficient and reliable action selection, we developed a framework for supervised learning of manipulation expertise. To verify the performance of our system, we conducted dozens of trials and report on several hours of experiments involving more than 1,500 interactions. The results show that our learning-based approach for pile manipulation outperforms a common sense heuristic as well as a random strategy, and is on par with human action selection.},

As a result, task description becomes simpler and more intuitive when specifying the desired impedance and the desired trajectories. This is the basis for the relative impedance control.

Therefore, RRT-based algorithms are used to build a tree of reachable and collision-free configurations. During RRT-generation, potential grasping positions are generated and approach movements toward them are computed. The quality of reachable grasping poses is scored with an online grasp quality measurement module which is based on the computation of applied forces in order to diminish the net torque.We also present an extension to a dual arm planner which generates bimanual grasps together with corresponding dual arm grasping motions.

Previous work has shown how statistical relational learning can be used in a discrete setting to extend affordances to model relations and interactions between multiple objects being manipulated by a robotic arm and deal with environment uncertainty. In this paper, we first extend this concept of relational affordances to a continuous setting and then to a two-arm robot. A relational affordance model can first be learnt for one arm through a behavioural babbling stage, and then with the use of statistical relational learning, after constructing a symmetrical model for the other arm, two-arm manipulation actions can be modelled, where the arms can act sequentially or simultaneously. The model is evaluated in a two-arm action recognition task in a shelf object manipulation setting.},

  doi = {10.1007/s10514-017-9637-x},
  abstract = {The concept of affordances has been used in robotics to model action opportunities of a robot and as a basis for making decisions involving objects. Affordances capture the interdependencies between the objects and their properties, the executed actions on those objects, and the effects of those respective actions. However, existing affordance models cannot cope with multiple objects that may interact during action execution. Our approach is unique in that possesses the following four characteristics. First, our model employs recent advances in probabilistic programming to learn affordance models that take into account (spatial) relations between different objects, such as relative distances. Two-object interaction models are first learned from the robot interacting with the world in a behavioural exploration stage, and are then employed in worlds with an arbitrary number of objects. The model thus generalizes over both the number of and the particular objects used in the exploration stage, and it also effectively deals with uncertainty. Secondly, rather than using a (discrete) action repertoire, the actions are parametrised according to the motor capabilities of the robot, which allows to model and achieve goals at several levels of complexity. It also supports a two-arm parametrised action. Thirdly, the relational affordance model represents the state of the world using both discrete (action and object features) and continuous (effects) random variables. The effects follow a multivariate Gaussian distribution with the correlated discrete variables (actions and object properties). Fourthly, the learned model can be employed on planning for high-level goals that closely correspond to goals formulated in natural language. The goals are specified by means of (spatial) relations between the objects. The model is evaluated in real experiments using an iCub robot given a series of such planning goals of increasing difficulty.},

  title = {Affordance Prediction via Learned Object Attributes},
  abstract = {Abstract \textemdash{} We present a novel method for learning and predicting the affordances of an object based on its physical and visual attributes. Affordance prediction is a key task in autonomous robot learning, as it allows a robot to reason about the actions it can perform in order to accomplish its goals. Previous approaches to affordance prediction have either learned direct mappings from visual features to affordances, or have introduced object categories as an intermediate representation. In this paper, we argue that physical and visual attributes provide a more appropriate mid-level representation for affordance prediction, because they support informationsharing between affordances and objects, resulting in superior generalization performance. In particular, affordances are more likely to be correlated with the attributes of an object than they are with its visual appearance or a linguistically-derived object category. We provide preliminary validation of our method experimentally, and present empirical comparisons to both the direct and category-based approaches of affordance prediction. Our encouraging results suggest the promise of the attributebased approach to affordance prediction. I.},

  abstract = {Detailed finite element modelling of needle insertions into soft tissue phantoms encounters difficulties of large deformations, high friction, contact loading and material failure. This paper demonstrates the use of cohesive elements in high-resolution finite element models to overcome some of the issues associated with these factors. Experiments are presented enabling extraction of the strain energy release rate during crack formation. Using data from these experiments, cohesive elements are calibrated and then implemented in models for validation of the needle insertion process. Successful modelling enables direct comparison of finite element and experimental force\textendash{}displacement plots and energy distributions. Regions of crack creation, relaxation, cutting and full penetration are identified. By closing the loop between experiments and detailed finite element modelling, a methodology is established which will enable design modifications of a soft tissue probe that steers through complex mechanical interactions with the surrounding material.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the use of the corotational cut Finite Element Method (FEM) for real-time surgical simulation. Users only need to provide a background mesh which is not necessarily conforming to the boundaries/interfaces of the simulated object. The details of the surface, which can be directly obtained from binary images, are taken into account by a multilevel embedding algorithm applied to elements of the background mesh that cut by the surface. Boundary conditions can be implicitly imposed on the surface using Lagrange multipliers. The implementation is verified by convergence studies with optimal rates. The algorithm is applied to various needle insertion simulations (e.g. for biopsy or brachytherapy) into brain and liver to verify the reliability of method, and numerical results show that the present method can make the discretisation independent from geometric description, and can avoid the complexity of mesh generation of complex geometries while retaining the accuracy of the standard FEM. Using the proposed approach is very suitable for real-time and patient specific simulations as it improves the simulation accuracy by taking into account automatically and properly the simulated geometry.},

  abstract = {Trip hazards are a significant contributor to accidents on construction and manufacturing sites. Current safety inspections are labor intensive and limited by human fallibility, making automation of trip hazard detection appealing from both a safety and economic perspective. Trip hazards present an interesting challenge to modern learning techniques because they are defined as much by affordance as by object type, for example, wires on a table are not a trip hazard, but can be if lying on the ground. To address these challenges, we conduct a comprehensive investigation into the performance characteristics of 11 different colors and depth fusion approaches, including four fusion and one nonfusion approach, using color and two types of depth images. Trained and tested on more than 600 labeled trip hazards over four floors and 2000 m2 in an active construction site, this approach was able to differentiate between identical objects in different physical configurations. Outperforming a color-only detector, our multimodal trip detector fuses color and depth information to achieve a 4\% absolute improvement in F1-score. These investigative results and the extensive publicly available dataset move us one step closer to assistive or fully automated safety inspection systems on construction sites.},

Moreover, the certificate is constructive: at run-time, it can be used to quickly find a solution to a given query.

  abstract = {An important aspect of human perception is anticipation, which we use extensively in our day-to-day activities when interacting with other humans as well as with our surroundings. Anticipating which activities will a human do next (and how) can enable an assistive robot to plan ahead for reactive responses. Furthermore, anticipation can even improve the detection accuracy of past activities. The challenge, however, is two-fold: We need to capture the rich context for modeling the activities and object affordances, and we need to anticipate the distribution over a large space of future human activities. In this work, we represent each possible future using an anticipatory temporal conditional random field (ATCRF) that models the rich spatial-temporal relations through object affordances. We then consider each ATCRF as a particle and represent the distribution over the potential futures using a set of particles. In extensive evaluation on CAD-120 human activity RGB-D dataset, we first show that anticipation improves the state-of-the-art detection results. We then show that for new subjects (not seen in the training set), we obtain an activity anticipation accuracy (defined as whether one of top three predictions actually happened) of 84.1, 74.4 and 62.2 percent for an anticipation time of 1, 3 and 10 seconds respectively. Finally, we also show a robot using our algorithm for performing a few reactive responses.},

Here, we treat the problem of designing motion primitives for cooperative manipulation such that the robots move in formation and are robust with respect to external disturbances. Individual robot trajectories are generated by Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) and coupled by a formation control approach enabling the DMP-trajectories to preserve a given formation while performing the manipulation. The proposed control scheme achieves an increased adaptability under external disturbances. The approach is evaluated in a full-scale experiment with two prototypical cooperative manipulation and synchronized motion tasks.},

  abstract = {Presents an approach to movement planning, on-line trajectory modification, and imitation learning by representing movement plans based on a set of nonlinear differential equations with well-defined attractor dynamics. The resultant movement plan remains an autonomous set of nonlinear differential equations that forms a control policy (CP) which is robust to strong external perturbations and that can be modified on-line by additional perceptual variables. We evaluate the system with a humanoid robot simulation and an actual humanoid robot. Experiments are presented for the imitation of three types of movements: reaching movements with one arm, drawing movements of 2-D patterns, and tennis swings. Our results demonstrate (a) that multi-joint human movements can be encoded successfully by the CPs, (b) that a learned movement policy can readily be reused to produce robust trajectories towards different targets, (c) that a policy fitted for one particular target provides a good predictor of human reaching movements towards neighboring targets, and (d) that the parameter space which encodes a policy is suitable for measuring to which extent two trajectories are qualitatively similar},

  abstract = {Robotics-assisted needle steering can enhance targeting accuracy in percutaneous interventions. This paper presents a novel dynamical model for robotically controlled needle steering. This is the first model that predicts both needle shape and tip position in soft tissue, and accepts needle insertion velocity, needle 180$^\circ$ axial rotation, and needle base force/torque as inputs. A hybrid formulation of needle steering dynamics in soft tissue is presented, which considers the needle as a two-body rigid/flexible coupled system composed of a moving, discrete, and rigid part attached to a vibrating compliant part that is subject to external excitation forces. The former is the carrier representing the surgeon's hand or the needle inserting robot, while the latter is a beam modeling the continuous deflection of the needle inside tissue. A novel time-delayed tissue model and a fracture mechanics-based model are developed to model the tissue reaction forces and cutting force at the needle tip, respectively. Experiments are performed on synthetic and ex vivo animal tissues to identify the model parameters and validate the needle steering model. The maximum error of the 2-D model in predicting the needle tip position in the insertion plane was 1.59 mm in the case of no axial rotation and 0.74 mm with axial rotation.},

These sensors measure the axial strain, which enables the computation of the needle curvature. We reconstruct the three-dimensional (3-D) needle shape from the curvature. Experiments are performed where the needle is deflected in free space. The maximum errors between the experiments and beam theory-based model are 0.20 mm (in-plane deflection with single bend), 0.51 mm (in-plane deflection with double bend), and 1.66 mm (out-of-plane). We also describe kinematics-based and mechanics-based models for predicting the 3-D needle shape during insertion into soft tissue. We perform experiments where the needle is inserted into a soft-tissue simulant, and the 3-D needle shape is reconstructed using the FBG sensors. We compare the reconstructed needle shape to deflection obtained from camera images and our models. The maximum error between the experiments and the camera images is 0.74 mm. The maximum errors between the kinematics-based and mechanics-based models and the camera images are 3.77 mm and 2.20 mm, respectively. This study demonstrates that deflection models and needles integrated with FBG sensors have the potential to be used in combination with clinical imaging modalities in order to enable accurate needle steering.},

  abstract = {In needle-based medical procedures, beveled tip flexible needles are steered inside soft tissue to reach the desired target locations. In this paper, we have developed an autonomous image-guided needle steering system that enhances targeting accuracy in needle insertion while minimizing tissue trauma. The system has three main components. First is a novel mechanics-based needle steering model that predicts needle deflection and accepts needle tip rotation as an input for needle steering. The second is a needle tip tracking system that determines needle deflection from the ultrasound images. The needle steering model employs the estimated needle deflection at the present time to predict needle tip trajectory in the future steps. The third component is a nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) that steers the needle inside the tissue by rotating the needle beveled tip. The MPC controller calculates control decisions based on iterative optimization of the predictions of the needle steering model. To validate the proposed ultrasound-guided needle steering system, needle insertion experiments in biological tissue phantoms are performed in two cases\textendash{}with and without obstacle.

  abstract = {We present algorithms for simulating and visualizing the insertion and steering of needles through deformable tissues for surgical training and planning. Needle insertion is an essential component of many clinical procedures such as biopsies, injections, neurosurgery, and brachytherapy cancer treatment. The success of these procedures depends on accurate guidance of the needle tip to a clinical target while avoiding vital tissues. Needle insertion deforms body tissues, making accurate placement difficult. Our interactive needle insertion simulator models the coupling between a steerable needle and deformable tissue. We introduce (1) a novel algorithm for local remeshing that quickly enforces the conformity of a tetrahedral mesh to a curvilinear needle path, enabling accurate computation of contact forces, (2) an efficient method for coupling a 3D finite element simulation with a 1D inextensible rod with stick-slip friction, and (3) optimizations that reduce the computation time for physically based simulations. We can realistically and interactively simulate needle insertion into a prostate mesh of 13,375 tetrahedra and 2,763 vertices at a 25 Hz frame rate on an 8-core 3.0 GHz Intel Xeon PC. The simulation models prostate brachytherapy with needles of varying stiffness, steering needles around obstacles, and supports motion planning for robotic needle insertion. We evaluate the accuracy of the simulation by comparing against real-world experiments in which flexible, steerable needles were inserted into gel tissue phantoms.},

The needle insertion point, needle heading, and needle depth are optimized by minimizing the distance between a rigid needle and a number of targets in the tissue. The optimization method is based on iterative simulations performed using a tissue finite element model. At each iteration, the best 3-D line fitted to the displaced targets in the deformed tissue is used as a candidate for a new insertion line. First, this method is implemented in a prostate brachytherapy simulator under different boundary conditions to minimize the targeting error. It is shown that the optimization method converges in a few iterations and decreases the seed misplacement error to less than the needle diameter. Second, the efficacy of the optimization algorithm is verified by optimizing the insertion parameters for a brachytherapy needle before insertion into a prostate tissue phantom. The elastic properties of the phantom and the needle-tissue interaction parameters were identified in an independent experiment. The optimization algorithm is effective in decreasing the targeting error.},

Ex vivo tissue experiments were performed to determine these mechanical tissue properties. A double insertion of the needle into the tissue was utilized to determine the fracture toughness. The shear modulus was found by applying an Ogden fit to the stress\textendash{}strain curve of the tissue achieved through tension experiments. The frictional force was measured by inserting the needle through precut tissue. Results show that the force model predicts within 0.2 N of experimental needle insertion force and the fracture toughness is primarily affected by the needle diameter and needle edge geometry. On average, the tearing force was found to account for 61\% of the total insertion force, the spreading force to account for 18\%, and the friction force to account for the remaining 21\%.},

  abstract = {We propose a method to estimate the entire shape of a long flexible needle, suitable for a needle insertion assistant robot. This method bases its prediction on only a small segment of a needle, imaged via ultrasound, after insertion. An algorithm is developed that can segment a needle observed partially in ultrasound images and fully in camera images, returning a polynomial representation of the needle shape after RANSAC processing. The polynomial corresponding to the partial needle observation in ultrasound images is used as the input to a needle-tissue interaction model that predicts the entire needle shape. The needle shape predicted by the model is compared to the segmented needle shape based on camera images to validate the proposed approach. The results show that the entire needle shape can be accurately predicted in tissues of varying stiffness based on observation of parts of the needle in an ultrasound image.},

Each of the assumed vibration modes are associated with a weighting coefficient whose magnitude is calculated using the minimum potential energy method. The model only requires as input the tissue stiffness and needle-tissue cutting force. Contributions of this letter include the estimation of needle-tissue contact forces as a function of the tissue displacement along the needle shaft, while allowing for multiple bends of the needle. The model is combined with partial ultrasound image feedback in order to adaptively calculate the needle-tissue cutting force as the needle is inserted. The image feedback is obtained by an ultrasound probe that follows the needle tip and stops at an appropriate position to avoid further tissue displacement. Images obtained during early stages of the insertion are used to predict the deflection of the needle further along the insertion process. Experimental results in biological and phantom tissue show an average error in predicting needle deflection of 0.36 mm.},

  lccn = {etd-011514-181525},
  abstract = {This thesis deals with automatic localization and tracking of surgical tools such as needles in Magnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI). The accurate and precise localization of needles is very important for medical interventions such as biopsy, brachytherapy, anaesthesia and many other needle based percutaneous interventions. Needle tracking has to be really precise, because the target may reside adjacent to organs which are sensitive to injury. More over during the needle insertion, Magnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI) scan plane must be aligned such that needle is in the field of view (FOV) for surgeon. Many approaches were proposed for needle tracking and automatic MRI scan plane control over last decade that use external markers, but they are not able to account for possible needle bending. Significant amount of work has already been done by using the image based approaches for needle tracking in Image Guided Therapy (IGT) but the existing approaches for surgical robots under MRI guidance are purely based on imaging information; they are missing the important fact that, a lot of important information (for example, depth of insertion, entry point and angle of insertion) is available from the kinematic model of the robot. The existing approaches are also not considering the fact that the needle insertion results in a time sequence of images. So the information about needle positions from the images seen so far can be used to make an approximate estimate about the needle position in the subsequent images. During the course of this thesis we have investigated an image based approach for needle tracking in real-time MR images that leverages additional information available from robot's kinematics model, supplementing the acquired images. The proposed approach uses Standard Hough Transform(SHT) for needle detection in 2D MR image and uses Kalman Filter for tracking the needle over the sequence of images. We have demonstrated experimental validation of the method on Real MRI data using gel phantom and artificially created test images. The results proved that the proposed method can track the needle tip position with root mean squared error of 1.5 mm for straight needle and 2.5mm for curved needle.},

  abstract = {In needle-based medical procedures, beveled tip flexible needles are steered inside soft tissue to reach the desired target locations. In this paper, we have developed an autonomous image-guided needle steering system that enhances targeting accuracy in needle insertion while minimizing tissue trauma. The system has three main components. First is a novel mechanics-based needle steering model that predicts needle deflection and accepts needle tip rotation as an input for needle steering. The second is a needle tip tracking system that determines needle deflection from the ultrasound images. The needle steering model employs the estimated needle deflection at the present time to predict needle tip trajectory in the future steps. The third component is a nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) that steers the needle inside the tissue by rotating the needle beveled tip. The MPC controller calculates control decisions based on iterative optimization of the predictions of the needle steering model. To validate the proposed ultrasound-guided needle steering system, needle insertion experiments in biological tissue phantoms are performed in two cases\textendash{}with and without obstacle. The results demonstrate that our needle steering strategy guides the needle to the desired targets with the maximum error of 2.85$<$math display="inline" overflow="scroll" altimg="eq-00001.gif"$>$$<$mspace width=".17em"$>$$<$/mspace$>$$<$/math$>$mm.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new class of thin, dexterous continuum robots, which we call active cannulas due to their potential medical applications. An active cannula is composed of telescoping, concentric, precurved superelastic tubes that can be axially translated and rotated at the base relative to one another. Active cannulas derive bending not from tendon wires or other external mechanisms but from elastic tube interaction in the backbone itself, permitting high dexterity and small size, and dexterity improves with miniaturization. They are designed to traverse narrow and winding environments without relying on ldquoguidingrdquo environmental reaction forces. These features seem ideal for a variety of applications where a very thin robot with tentacle-like dexterity is needed. In this paper, we apply beam mechanics to obtain a kinematic model of active cannula shape and describe design tools that result from the modeling process. After deriving general equations, we apply them to a simple three-link active cannula. Experimental results illustrate the importance of including torsional effects and the ability of our model to predict energy bifurcation and active cannula shape.},

Bridging this gap requires reliable and easy-to-use robotic systems. Methods Our system for image-guided needle placement requires only simple, low-cost components and minimal, entirely off-line calibration. It rapidly aligns needles to planned entry paths using 3D ultrasound (US) reconstructed from freehand 2D scans. We compare system accuracy against clinical standard manual needle placement. Results The US-guided robotic system is significantly more accurate than single manual insertions. When several manual withdrawals and reinsertions are allowed, accuracy becomes equivalent. In ex vivo experiments, robotic repeatability was 1.56 mm, compared to 3.19 and 4.63 mm for two sets of manual insertions. In an in vivo experiment with heartbeat and respiratory effects, robotic system accuracy was 5.5 mm. Conclusions A 3D US-guided robot can eliminate error bias and reduce invasiveness (the number of insertions required) compared to manual needle insertion. Remaining future challenges include target motion compensation. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

This paper presents a survey of the current state of research on needle insertion in soft tissue. It examines the topic from several aspects, e.g. modeling needle insertion forces, modeling tissue deformation and needle deflection during insertion, robot-assisted needle insertion, and the effect of different trajectories on tissue deformation. All studies show that the axial force of a needle during insertion in soft tissue is the summation of different forces distributed along the needle shaft such as stiffness force, frictional force and cutting force. Some studies have modeled these forces. The force data in some procedures is used for identifying tissue layers as the needle is inserted or for path planning. Needle deflection and tissue deformation are major problems for accurate needle insertion and attempts have been made to model them. Using current models several insertion techniques have been developed which are briefly reviewed in this paper.},

  abstract = {Needles with tip asymmetry deflect upon insertion into soft tissue, an effect that can be used to steer needles within the body. This paper presents a phenomenological characterization of the steering behavior of pre-curved needles, which have tip asymmetry due to curvature of the needle near the tip. We describe needle construction methods and a needle shaft triangulation algorithm to compute the shape of the needle based on images. Experimental results show that pre-curved needles possess greater dexterity than bevel-tipped needles and achieve radii of curvature similar to pre-bent needles. For long pre-curve arc lengths, the radius of curvature of the needle was found to approach the radius of curvature of the pre-curve. Pre-curved needles were found to display behaviors not seen with bevel-tipped needles, such as the insertion velocity influencing the path of the tip within the tissue and the ability to plastically deform the needle during steering.},

Transoral access is preferred to percutaneous access since it has a lower risk of lung collapse, yet many sites are currently unreachable transorally due to limitations with current bronchoscopic instruments. Toward this end, we present a new robotic system for image-guided trans-bronchoscopic lung access. The system uses a bronchoscope to navigate in the airway and bronchial tubes to a site near the desired target, a concentric tube robot to move through the bronchial wall and aim at the target, and a bevel-tip steerable needle with magnetic tracking to maneuver through lung tissue to the target under closed-loop control. In this work, we illustrate the workflow of our system and show accurate targeting in phantom experiments. Ex vivo porcine lung experiments show that our steerable needle can be tuned to achieve appreciable curvature in lung tissue. Lastly, we present targeting results with our system using two scenarios based on patient cases. In these experiments, phantoms were created from patient-specific computed tomography information and our system was used to target the locations of suspicious nodules, illustrating the ability of our system to reach sites that are traditionally inaccessible transorally.},

An active cannula is composed of telescoping, concentric, precurved superelastic tubes that can be axially translated and rotated at the base relative to one another. Active cannulas derive bending not from tendon wires or other external mechanisms but from elastic tube interaction in the backbone itself, permitting high dexterity and small size, and dexterity improves with miniaturization. They are designed to traverse narrow and winding environments without relying on ldquoguidingrdquo environmental reaction forces. These features seem ideal for a variety of applications where a very thin robot with tentacle-like dexterity is needed. In this paper, we apply beam mechanics to obtain a kinematic model of active cannula shape and describe design tools that result from the modeling process. After deriving general equations, we apply them to a simple three-link active cannula. Experimental results illustrate the importance of including torsional effects and the ability of our model to predict energy bifurcation and active cannula shape.},

  abstract = {Flexible, tip-steerable needles promise to enhance physicianspsila abilities to accurately reach targets and maneuver inside the human body while minimizing patient trauma. Here, we present a functional needle steering system that integrates two components: (1) a patient-specific 2D pre- and intraoperative planner that finds an achievable route to a target within a planar slice of tissue (Stochastic Motion Roadmap), and (2) a low-level image-guided feedback controller that keeps the needle tip within that slice. The planner generates a sequence of circular arcs that can be realized by interleaving pure insertions with 180deg rotations of the needle shaft. This pre-planned sequence is updated in realtime at regular intervals. Concurrently, the low-level image-based controller servos the needle to remain close to the desired plane between plan updates. Both planner and controller are predicated on a previously developed kinematic nonholonomic model of beveltip needle steering. We use slighly different needles here that have a small bend near the tip, so we extend the model to account for discontinuities of the tip position caused by 180deg rotations. Further, during large rotations of the needle base, we maintain the desired tip angle by compensating for torsional compliance in the needle shaft, neglected in previous needle steering work. By integrating planning, control, and torsion compensation, we demonstrate both accurate targeting and obstacle avoidance.},

This in vitro study quantifies spinal needle deflection from the axis of insertion with respect to needle type, gauge, and tip bend. In addition to straight-tip needles, those with standardized 5 degrees and 10 degrees tip bends were studied. The purpose was to examine the effect of tip bend, which has been described with small gauge spinal needles after bony contact, on needle path deflection. Needles studied included Quincke (Q), Sprotte (S), and Whitacre (W) in sizes ranging from 18-gauge to 29-gauge. Needles were inserted perpendicularly into porcine paraspinous muscle followed by radiologic investigation. Measurements of needle deflection from the axis of insertion at depths of 20, 40, and 60 mm were performed in a blinded fashion. Straight-tip Q needle deflection, but not W or S, was correlated with gauge and depth of insertion. Although there were differences within needle type groups, needle deflection was generally correlated with the degree of tip bend. We conclude that spinal needle deflection is dependent on the type of needle (W $<$ S $<$ Q), and that the magnitude of deflection is related to gauge (large $<$ small) and tip bend (straight $<$ 5 degrees $<$ 10 degrees).},

  abstract = {A flexible needle can be accurately steered by robotically controlling the orientation of the bevel tip as the needle is inserted into tissue. Here, we demonstrate the significant effect of friction between the long, flexible needle shaft and the tissue, which can cause a significant discrepancy between the orientation of the needle tip and the orientation of the base where the needle is controlled. Our experiments show that several common phantom tissues used in needle steering experiments impart substantial frictional forces to the needle shaft, resulting in a lag of over 45deg for a 10 cm insertion depth in some phantoms; clinical studies have reported torques large enough to could cause similar errors during needle insertions. Such angle discrepancies will result in poor performance or failure of path planners and image-guided controllers, since the needles used in percutaneous procedures are too small for state-of-the-art imaging to accurately measure the tip angle. To compensate for the angle discrepancy, we develop a model for the rotational dynamics of a needle being continuously inserted into tissue and show how a PD controller is sufficient to compensate for the rotational dynamics.},

  abstract = {Ultrasonographically (US) guided core needle biopsy is currently recognized as a reliable alternative to surgical biopsy for the histopathologic diagnosis of breast lesions. However, despite advances in biopsy devices and techniques, false-negative diagnoses are unavoidable and may delay the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. The most common reasons for false-negative diagnosis are (a) technical or sampling errors, (b) failure to recognize or act on radiologic-histologic discordance, and (c) lack of imaging follow-up after a benign biopsy result. Technical difficulties (eg, poor lesion or needle visualization, deeply located lesions, dense fibrotic tissue) cause inaccurate sampling but can be reduced by using modified standard techniques. Radiologic-histologic correlation is also of critical importance in US-guided core needle biopsy. Radiologic-histologic discordance occurs when the histologic results do not provide a sufficient explanation for the imaging features and indicates that the lesion may not have been sampled adequately, so that repeat biopsy is warranted. Appropriate follow-up imaging is invaluable; even patients with concordant benign findings after US-guided core needle biopsy are directed to undergo follow-up imaging because there may be delays in the recognition of false-negative findings. Optimization of technique, radiologic-histologic correlation, and postbiopsy follow-up protocols are recommended to reduce the occurrence of false-negative diagnosis at US-guided core needle biopsy performed by radiologists.},

  doi = {10.1118/1.598971},
  abstract = {In prostate seed implants, radioactive seeds are implanted into the prostate through a guiding needle with the help of a template and real-time imaging. The ideal locations of the guiding needles and the relative positions of the seeds in each needle are determined before the implantation under the assumption that the needles inserted at different locations will remain parallel. In actual implantation, the direction of the needle is subject variation. In this work, we studied how the dosimetry quality of an implant may be affected when the guiding needles deviate from its planned orientations. Needle divergence of varying degree was simulated on spherical models and actual patient implants. It was found that needle divergence degraded the dosimetric quality of an implant: The minimum target dose, the target dose coverage and therefore the tumor biological effective dose were quantitatively decreased as compared to the reference implant. The magnitude of degradation increased almost linearly with respect to the magnitude of needle divergence. For iodine-125 implants, the average reduction in minimum target dose was about 10\% and 20\% for needle divergence of standard deviation of 5(0) and 10(0), respectively. The dose coverage in the target was reduced by about 1\% and 3\% for needle divergence of standard deviation of 5(0) and 10(0), respectively. Implants designed with palladium-103 showed additional 5\% reduction in minimum target dose while the effect on dose coverage was about the same as compared to the iodine-125 implants. The degree of dosimetry degradation was shown to be dependent on the size of target volume, the seed spacing used, the use of seeding margin, and on the actual configuration of needle orientations in a given implant. One needs to minimize the physical causes of needle divergence in order to minimize its impact on planned dosimetry. The study suggests that the displacement between a needle image and its planned grid point at the base of prostate should be kept less than 5 mm in order to minimize the reduction in D(min)($<$5\%) and the increase in cell-survival ($<$ a factor of 10) from the planned dosimetry.},

  abstract = {Purpose
To assess retrospectively the clinical accuracy of an magnetic
resonance imaging-guided robotic prostate biopsy system that has been used
in the US National Cancer Institute for over 6 years.

Methods
Series of 2D transverse volumetric MR image slices of the prostate
both pre (high-resolution T2-weighted)-and post (low-resolution)-needle
insertions were used to evaluate biopsy accuracy. A three-stage registration
algorithm consisting of an initial two-step rigid registration followed by a
B-spline deformable alignment was developed to capture prostate motion
during biopsy. The target displacement (distance between planned and actual
biopsy target), needle placement error (distance from planned biopsy target
to needle trajectory), and biopsy error (distance from actual biopsy target
to needle trajectory) were calculated as accuracy assessment.

Results
A total of 90 biopsies from 24 patients were studied. The
registrations were validated by checking prostate contour alignment using
image overlay, and the results were accurate to within 2 mm. The mean target
displacement, needle placement error, and clinical biopsy error were 5.2,
2.5, and 4.3 mm, respectively.

Conclusion
The biopsy error reported suggests that quantitative imaging
techniques for prostate registration and motion compensation may improve
prostate biopsy targeting accuracy.},

To compare the accuracy of a robotic interventional radiologist (IR) assistance platform with a standard freehand technique for computed-tomography (CT)-guided biopsy and simulated radiofrequency ablation (RFA).

Methods
The accuracy of freehand single-pass needle insertions into abdominal phantoms was compared with insertions facilitated with the use of a robotic assistance platform (n = 20 each). Post-procedural CTs were analysed for needle placement error. Percutaneous RFA was simulated by sequentially placing five 17-gauge needle introducers into 5-cm diameter masses (n = 5) embedded within an abdominal phantom. Simulated ablations were planned based on pre-procedural CT, before multi-probe placement was executed freehand. Multi-probe placement was then performed on the same 5-cm mass using the ablation planning software and robotic assistance. Post-procedural CTs were analysed to determine the percentage of untreated residual target.

Results
Mean needle tip-to-target errors were reduced with use of the IR assistance platform (both P $<$ 0.0001). Reduced percentage residual tumour was observed with treatment planning (P = 0.02).

Conclusion
Improved needle accuracy and optimised probe geometry are observed during simulated CT-guided biopsy and percutaneous ablation with use of a robotic IR assistance platform. This technology may be useful for clinical CT-guided biopsy and RFA, when accuracy may have an impact on outcome.},

  abstract = {Objectives MRI is of great clinical utility for the guidance of special diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. The majority of such procedures are performed iteratively ("in-and-out") in standard, closed-bore MRI systems with control imaging inside the bore and needle adjustments outside the bore. The fundamental limitations of such an approach have led to the development of various assistance techniques, from simple guidance tools to advanced navigation systems. The purpose of this work was to thoroughly assess the targeting accuracy, workflow and usability of a clinical add-on navigation solution on 240 simulated biopsies by different medical operators. Methods Navigation relied on a virtual 3D MRI scene with real-time overlay of the optically tracked biopsy needle. Smart reference markers on a freely adjustable arm ensured proper registration. Twenty-four operators \textendash{} attending (AR) and resident radiologists (RR) as well as medical students (MS) \textendash{} performed well-controlled biopsies of 10 embedded model targets (mean diameter: 8.5 mm, insertion depths: 17-76 mm). Targeting accuracy, procedure times and 13 Likert scores on system performance were determined (strong agreement: 5.0). Results Differences in diagnostic success rates (AR: 93\%, RR: 88\%, MS: 81\%) were not significant. In contrast, between-group differences in biopsy times (AR: 4:15, RR: 4:40, MS: 5:06 min:sec) differed significantly (p$<$0.01). Mean overall rating was 4.2. The average operator would use the system again (4.8) and stated that the outcome justifies the extra effort (4.4). Lowest agreement was reported for the robustness against external perturbations (2.8). Conclusions The described combination of optical tracking technology with an automatic MRI registration appears to be sufficiently accurate for instrument guidance in a standard (closed-bore) MRI environment. High targeting accuracy and usability was demonstrated on a relatively large number of procedures and operators. Between groups with different expertise there were significant differences in experimental procedure times but not in the number of successful biopsies.},

  abstract = {Forty computed tomography (CT)-assisted aspirations performed with only hand guidance were prospectively compared with 40 performed with a CT body-stereotaxic system. Although there was no statistically significant difference in lesion size and path length between the two groups, use of stereotaxis compared with hand guidance decreased by 75\% the number of needle manipulations required to place a needle within a lesion. With the stereotaxic method, only 43 needle manipulations were required to confirm a needle placement in 40 lesions, with no lesion requiring more than two attempts. Use of stereotaxis decreased the number of localization scans by 80\% and biopsy time by 50\%. It is concluded that CT-guided needle placements with hand guidance are often inaccurate and, unless the lesion is large, require multiple needle manipulations to place a needle within the lesion. Stereotaxis-guided biopsies, on the other hand, decrease radiation exposure, biopsy time, and trauma from multiple needle punctures.},

The robot-assisted minimally-invasive surgery is well recognized as a feasible solution for diagnosis and treatment of the prostate cancer in human.

Methods
In this paper the kinematics of a parallel 4 Degrees-of-Freedom (DOF) surgical manipulator designed for minimally invasive in-bore prostate percutaneous interventions through the patient's perineum. The proposed manipulator takes advantage of 4 sliders actuated by MRI-compatible piezoelectric motors and incremental rotary encoders. Errors, mostly originating from the design and manufacturing process, need to be identified and reduced before the robot is deployed in the clinical trials.

Results
The manipulator has undergone several experiments to evaluate the repeatability and accuracy of the needle placement which is an essential concern in percutaneous prostate interventions.

Conclusion
The acquired results endorse the sustainability, precision (about 1 mm in air (in x or y direction) at the needle's reference point) and reliability of the manipulator.},

  abstract = {Purpose
To demonstrate the utility of a robotic needle-guidance template device as compared to a manual template for in-bore 3T transperineal MR-guided prostate biopsy.

Materials and Methods
This two-arm mixed retrospective-prospective study included 99 cases of targeted transperineal prostate biopsies. The biopsy needles were aimed at suspicious foci noted on multiparametric 3T MRI using manual template (historical control) as compared with a robotic template. The following data was obtained: the accuracy of average and closest needle placement to the focus, histologic yield, percentage of cancer volume in positive core samples, complication rate, and time to complete the procedure.

Results
56 cases were performed using the manual template, and 43 cases were performed using the robotic template. The mean accuracy of the best needle placement attempt was higher in the robotic group (2.39 mm) than the manual group (3.71 mm, p$<$0.027). The mean core procedure time was shorter in the robotic (90.82min) than the manual group (100.63min, p$<$0.030). Percentage of cancer volume in positive core samples was higher in robotic group (p$<$0.001). Cancer yields and complication rates were not statistically different between the two sub-groups (p = 0.557 and p=0.172 respectively).

Conclusion
The robotic needle-guidance template helps accurate placement of biopsy needles in MRI-guided core biopsy of prostate cancer.},

  doi = {10.1002/mrm.25300},
  abstract = {Purpose
To develop an active MR-tracking system to guide placement of metallic devices for radiation therapy.

Methods
An actively tracked metallic stylet for brachytherapy was constructed by adding printed-circuit micro-coils to a commercial stylet. The coil design was optimized by electromagnetic simulation, and has a radio-frequency lobe pattern extending \textasciitilde{}5 mm beyond the strong B0 inhomogeneity region near the metal surface. An MR-tracking sequence with phase-field dithering was used to overcome residual effects of B0 and B1 inhomogeneities caused by the metal, as well as from inductive coupling to surrounding metallic stylets. The tracking system was integrated with a graphical workstation for real-time visualization. 3T MRI catheter-insertion procedures were tested in phantoms and ex-vivo animal tissue, and then performed in three patients during interstitial brachytherapy.

Results
The tracking system provided high-resolution (0.6 \texttimes{} 0.6 \texttimes{} 0.6 mm3) and rapid (16 to 40 frames per second, with three to one phase-field dithering directions) catheter localization in phantoms, animals, and three gynecologic cancer patients.

Conclusion
This is the first demonstration of active tracking of the shaft of metallic stylet in MR-guided brachytherapy. It holds the promise of assisting physicians to achieve better targeting and improving outcomes in interstitial brachytherapy.},

  abstract = {Purpose:
In gynecologic cancers, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is the modality of choice for visualizing tumors and their surroundings because of superior soft-tissue contrast. Real-time MR guidance of catheter placement in interstitial brachytherapy facilitates target coverage, and would be further improved by providing intraprocedural estimates of dosimetric coverage. A major obstacle to intraprocedural dosimetry is the time needed for catheter trajectory reconstruction. Herein the authors evaluate an active MR tracking (MRTR) system which provides rapid catheter tip localization and trajectory reconstruction. The authors assess the reliability and spatial accuracy of the MRTR system in comparison to standard catheter digitization using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and CT.

Methods:
The MRTR system includes a stylet with microcoils mounted on its shaft, which can be inserted into brachytherapy catheters and tracked by a dedicated MRTR sequence. Catheter tip localization errors of the MRTR system and their dependence on catheter locations and orientation inside the MR scanner were quantified with a water phantom. The distances between the tracked tip positions of the MRTR stylet and the predefined ground-truth tip positions were calculated for measurements performed at seven locations and with nine orientations. To evaluate catheter trajectory reconstruction, fifteen brachytherapy catheters were placed into a gel phantom with an embedded catheter fixation framework, with parallel or crossed paths. The MRTR stylet was then inserted sequentially into each catheter. During the removal of the MRTR stylet from within each catheter, a MRTR measurement was performed at 40 Hz to acquire the instantaneous stylet tip position, resulting in a series of three-dimensional (3D) positions along the catheter's trajectory. A 3D polynomial curve was fit to the tracked positions for each catheter, and equally spaced dwell points were then generated along the curve. High-resolution 3D MRI of the phantom was performed followed by catheter digitization based on the catheter's imaging artifacts. The catheter trajectory error was characterized in terms of the mean distance between corresponding dwell points in MRTR-generated catheter trajectory and MRI-based catheter digitization. The MRTR-based catheter trajectory reconstruction process was also performed on three gynecologic cancer patients, and then compared with catheter digitization based on MRI and CT.

Results:
The catheter tip localization error increased as the MRTR stylet moved further off-center and as the stylet's orientation deviated from the main magnetic field direction. Fifteen catheters' trajectories were reconstructed by MRTR. Compared with MRI-based digitization, the mean 3D error of MRTR-generated trajectories was 1.5 $\pm$ 0.5 mm with an in-plane error of 0.7 $\pm$ 0.2 mm and a tip error of 1.7 $\pm$ 0.5 mm. MRTR resolved ambiguity in catheter assignment due to crossed catheter paths, which is a common problem in image-based catheter digitization. In the patient studies, the MRTR-generated catheter trajectory was consistent with digitization based on both MRI and CT.

Conclusions:
The MRTR system provides accurate catheter tip localization and trajectory reconstruction in the MR environment. Relative to the image-based methods, it improves the speed, safety, and reliability of the catheter trajectory reconstruction in interstitial brachytherapy. MRTR may enable in-procedural dosimetric evaluation of implant target coverage.},

We report the findings of a transperineal magnetic resonance image (MRI) guided biopsy of the prostate in a man with increasing prostate specific antigen who was not a candidate for a transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy.
Materials and Methods
Using an open configuration 0.5 Tesla MRI scanner and pelvic coil, a random sextant sample was obtained under real time MRI guidance from the peripheral zone of the prostate gland as well as a single core from each MRI defined lesion. The patient had previously undergone proctocolectomy for ulcerative colitis and, therefore, was not a candidate for transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy. Prior attempts to make the diagnosis of prostate cancer using a transurethral approach were unsuccessful.
Results
The random sextant samples contained benign prostatic hyperplasia, whereas Gleason grade 3 + 3 = 6 adenocarcinoma was confirmed in 15\% and 25\% of the 2 cores obtained from the MRI targeted specimens of 2 defined lesions. The procedure was well tolerated by the patient.
Conclusions
Transperineal MRI guided biopsy is a new technique that may be useful in detecting prostate cancer in men with increasing prostate specific antigen who are not candidates for transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy.},

Here, we present a functional needle steering system that integrates two components: (1) a patient-specific 2D pre- and intraoperative planner that finds an achievable route to a target within a planar slice of tissue (Stochastic Motion Roadmap), and (2) a low-level image-guided feedback controller that keeps the needle tip within that slice. The planner generates a sequence of circular arcs that can be realized by interleaving pure insertions with 180deg rotations of the needle shaft. This pre-planned sequence is updated in realtime at regular intervals. Concurrently, the low-level image-based controller servos the needle to remain close to the desired plane between plan updates. Both planner and controller are predicated on a previously developed kinematic nonholonomic model of beveltip needle steering. We use slighly different needles here that have a small bend near the tip, so we extend the model to account for discontinuities of the tip position caused by 180deg rotations. Further, during large rotations of the needle base, we maintain the desired tip angle by compensating for torsional compliance in the needle shaft, neglected in previous needle steering work. By integrating planning, control, and torsion compensation, we demonstrate both accurate targeting and obstacle avoidance.},

  abstract = {Susceptibility-induced geometry and intensity distortions are a familiar observation in MR imaging. In the past few years several attempts have been made to aid in the understanding of susceptibility artifacts by means of simulation studies. Although these studies, which were mostly carried out with simple test objects, have produced some qualitative insight into $\chi$-artifacts, the results lacked precision in describing finer details. In this paper we show the discrepancy between theory and experiment in previous work to be the result of an inadequate theoretical approach. In most studies so far, $\Delta$B0 effects are taken into account in the frequency domain, that is, after Fourier transformation of the data. In our view the simulation should follow the actual sequence of events in an imaging experiment and deal with the effect of error fields in the time domain (k-space) already. The correctness of this view is demonstrated here by comparing the results of time and frequency domain simulation against experimental observation for a coaxial cylinder phantom, a widely used model in this type of work. Having established the superiority of the time domain simulation, we demonstrate its use in predicting $\chi$-artifacts under various experimental conditions, for example, in spin-echo and gradient-echo imaging with a reduced number of phaseencoding steps.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a robotic system for steering under real-time fluoroscopic guidance a flexible needle in soft tissue. Given a target and possible obstacle locations, the computer calculates the flexible needle-tip trajectory that avoids the obstacle and hits the target. Using an inverse kinematics algorithm, the needle base maneuvers required for a tip to follow this trajectory are calculated, enabling a robot to perform controlled needle insertion. Assuming small displacements, the flexible needle is modeled as a linear beam supported by virtual springs, where the stiffness coefficients of the springs can vary along the needle. Using this simplified model, the forward and inverse kinematics of the needle are solved analytically, enabling both path planning and path correction in real time. The needle shape is detected in real time from fluoroscopic images, and the controller commands the needle base motion that minimizes the needle tip error. This approach was verified experimentally using a robot to maneuver the base of a flexible needle inserted into a muscle tissue. Along the 40-mm trajectory that avoids the obstacle and hits the target, the error stayed below the 0.5-mm level. This study demonstrates the ability to perform closed-loop control and steering of a flexible needle by maneuvering the needle base so that its tip achieves a planned trajectory.},

Recent mechanics-based models of these ``active cannulas'' are able to accurately describe the curve of the robot in free space, given the preformed tube curves and the linear and angular positions of the tube bases. However, in practical applications, where the active cannula must interact with its environment or apply controlled forces, a model that accounts for deformation under external loading is required. In this paper, we apply geometrically exact rod theory to produce a forward kinematic model that accurately describes large deflections due to a general collection of externally applied point and/or distributed wrench loads. This model accommodates arbitrarily many tubes, with each having a general preshaped curve. It also describes the independent torsional deformation of the individual tubes. Experimental results are provided for both point and distributed loads. Average tip error under load was 2.91 mm (1.5\% - 3\% of total robot length), which is similar to the accuracy of existing free-space models.},

By rotation and extension of the tubes with respect to each other, their curvatures interact elastically to position and orient the robot's tip, as well as to control the robot's shape along its length. In this approach, the flexible tubes comprise both the links and the joints of the robot.

  abstract = {A novel approach toward construction of robots is based on a concentric combination of precurved elastic tubes. By rotation and extension of the tubes with respect to each other, their curvatures interact elastically to position and orient the robot's tip, as well as to control the robot's shape along its length. In this approach, the flexible tubes comprise both the links and the joints of the robot. Since the actuators attach to the tubes at their proximal ends, the robot itself forms a slender curve that is well suited for minimally invasive medical procedures.

  abstract = {Quantitative analysis has tremendous but mostly unrealized potential in healthcare to support objective and accurate interpretation of the clinical imaging. In 2008, the National Cancer Institute began building the Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) initiative with the goal of advancing quantitative imaging in the context of personalized therapy and evaluation of treatment response. Computerized analysis is an important component contributing to reproducibility and efficiency of the quantitative imaging techniques. The success of quantitative imaging is contingent on robust analysis methods and software tools to bring these methods from bench to bedside., 3D Slicer is a free open source software application for medical image computing. As a clinical research tool, 3D Slicer is similar to a radiology workstation that supports versatile visualizations but also provides advanced functionality such as automated segmentation and registration for a variety of application domains. Unlike a typical radiology workstation, 3D Slicer is free and is not tied to specific hardware. As a programming platform, 3D Slicer facilitates translation and evaluation of the new quantitative methods by allowing the biomedical researcher to focus on the implementation of the algorithm, and providing abstractions for the common tasks of data communication, visualization and user interface development. Compared to other tools that provide aspects of this functionality, 3D Slicer is fully open source and can be readily extended and redistributed. In addition, 3D Slicer is designed to facilitate the development of new functionality in the form of 3D Slicer extensions., In this paper, we present an overview of 3D Slicer as a platform for prototyping, development and evaluation of image analysis tools for clinical research applications. To illustrate the utility of the platform in the scope of QIN, we discuss several use cases of 3D Slicer by the existing QIN teams, and we elaborate on the future directions that can further facilitate development and validation of imaging biomarkers using 3D Slicer.},

  abstract = {3D Slicer is an open-source platform for the analysis and display of information derived from medical imaging and similar data sets. Such advanced software environments are in daily use by researchers and clinicians and in many nonmedical applications. 3D Slicer is unique through serving clinical users, multidisciplinary clinical research terms, and software architects within a single technology structure and user community. Functions such as interactive visualization, image registration, and model-based analysis are now being complemented by more advanced capabilities, most notably in neurological imaging and intervention. These functions, originally limited to offline use by technical factors, are integral to large scale, rapidly developing research studies, and they are being increasingly integrated into the management and delivery of care. This activity has been led by a community of basic, applied, and clinical scientists and engineers, from both academic and commercial perspectives. 3D Slicer, a free open-source software package, is based in this community; 3D Slicer provides a set of interactive tools and a stable platform that can quickly incorporate new analysis techniques and evolve to serve more sophisticated real-time applications while remaining compatible with the latest hardware and software generations of host computer systems.},

  abstract = {Steerable needles can be used in medical applications to reach targets behind sensitive or impenetrable areas. The kinematics of a steerable needle are non-holonomic and, in two dimensions, equivalent to a Dubins car with constant radius of curvature. In three dimensions, the needle can be interpreted as an airplane with constant speed and pitch rate, zero yaw, and controllable roll angle. We present a constant-time motion planning algorithm for steerable needles based on explicit geometric inverse kinematics similar to the classic Paden\textemdash{} Kahan subproblems. Reachability and path competitivity are analyzed using analytic comparisons with shortest path solutions for the Dubins car (for two dimensions) and numerical simulations (for three dimensions). We also present an algorithm for local path adaptation using null-space results from redundant manipulator theory. Finally, we discuss several ways to use and extend the inverse kinematics solution to generate needle paths that avoid obstacles.},
