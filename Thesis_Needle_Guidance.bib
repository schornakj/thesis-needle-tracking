	abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides excellent image contrast for various types of tissues, making it a suitable choice over other imaging modalities for various image-guided needle interventions. Furthermore, robot-assistance is maturing for surgical procedures such as percutaneous prostate and brain interventions. Although MRI-guided, robot-assisted needle interventions are approaching clinical usage, they are still typically open-loop in nature due to the lack of continuous intraoperative needle tracking. Closed-loop needle-based procedures can improve the accuracy of needle tip placement by correcting the needle trajectory during insertion. This paper proposes a system for robot-assisted, flexible asymmetric-tipped needle interventions under continuous intraoperative MRI guidance. A flexible needle's insertion depth and rotation angle are manipulated by an MRI-compatible robot in the bore of the MRI scanner during continuous multi-planar image acquisition to reach a desired target location. Experiments are performed on gelatin phantoms to assess the accuracy of needle placement into the target location. The system was able to successfully utilize live MR imaging to guide the path of the needle, and results show an average total targeting error of 2.5±0.47mm, with an average in-plane error of 2.09±0.33mm.},

The targeting accuracy is evaluated with optical tracking system and gelatin phantom under live MRI-guidance with Root Mean Square (RMS) errors of 1.94 and 2.17 mm respectively.

This was evaluated in both free space and MRI-guided gelatin phantom trails, with RMS errors of 0.48 and 0.59 mm respectively.

The 6-degrees-of-freedom (DOF) robot consists of a modular 3-DOF needle driver with fiducial tracking frame and a 3-DOF actuated Cartesian stage. The needle driver provides needle cannula rotation and translation (2-DOF) and stylet translation (1-DOF). The driver mimics the manual physician gesture by two point grasping. To render proprioception associated with prostate interventions, a Fabry Perot interferometer based fiber optic strain sensor is designed to provide high-resolution axial needle insertion force measurement and is robust to large range of temperature variation. The paper explains the robot mechanism, controller design, optical modeling and opto-mechanical design of the force sensor. MRI compatibility of the robot is evaluated under 3T MRI using standard prostate imaging sequences and average signal noise ratio (SNR) loss is limited to 2\% during actuator motion. A dynamic needle insertion is performed and bevel tip needle steering capability is demonstrated under continuous real-time MRI guidance, both with no visually identifiable interference during robot motion.

Existing MRI-compatible force sensors have limited number of degrees of freedom or they do not offer compact solutions for multiple-axis sensing. In this paper, a compact 1-axis force sensing unit which employs a compliant displacement amplification mechanism is introduced and then analyzed for better sensitivity and accuracy. A combination of multiple proposed sensing units can be assembled to have a force sensor with desired number of degrees of freedom. Prototypes made of delrin and ABS-plastic are tested. Experiments indicated that the proposed sensor is suitable for force sensing and fully compatible to MRI. Also, the sensor made of delrin is superior in mechanical performance and MRI compatibility to ABS-plastic sample.},

The data were measured and modeled in three parts: 1) capsule stiffness, a nonlinear spring model; 2) friction, a modified Karnopp model; and 3) cutting, a constant for a given tissue. In addition, we characterized the effects of needle diameter and tip type on insertion force using a silicone rubber phantom. In comparison to triangular and diamond tips, a bevel tip causes more needle bending and is more easily affected by tissue density variations. Forces for larger diameter needles are higher due to increased cutting and friction forces.},

This paper takes a step toward automating the guidance of a flexible tip-steerable needle as it is inserted into the human tissue. We build upon a previously proposed nonholonomic model of needles that derive steering from asymmetric bevel forces at the tip. The bevel-tip needle is inserted and rotated at its base in order to steer it in 6 DOF. As a first step for control, we show that the needle tip can be automatically guided to a planar slice of the tissue as it is inserted. Our approach keeps the physician in the loop to control insertion speed. The distance of the needle tip position from the plane of interest is used to drive an observer-based feedback controller that we prove is locally asymptotically stable. Numerical simulations demonstrate a large domain of attraction and robustness of the controller in the face of parametric uncertainty and measurement noise. Physical experiments with tip-steerable nitinol needles inserted into a transparent plastisol tissue phantom under stereo image guidance validate the effectiveness of our approach.},

The inability to use conventional mechatronics and the confined physical space makes it extremely challenging to access the patient. We have designed a robotic assistant system that overcomes these difficulties and promises safe and reliable intraprostatic needle placement inside closed high-field MRI scanners. MRI compatibility of the robot has been evaluated under 3T MRI using standard prostate imaging sequences and average SNR loss is limited to 5\%. Needle alignment accuracy of the robot under servo pneumatic control is better than 0.94 mm rms per axis. The complete system workflow has been evaluated in phantom studies with accurate visualization and targeting of five out of five 1 cm targets.

	abstract = {A flexible needle can be accurately steered by robotically controlling the bevel tip orientation as the needle is inserted into tissue. Friction between the long, flexible needle shaft and the tissue can cause a significant discrepancy between the orientation of the needle tip and the orientation of the base where the needle angle is controlled. Our experiments show that several common phantom tissues used in needle steering experiments impart substantial friction forces to the needle shaft, resulting in a lag of more than 45deg for a 10 cm insertion depth in some phantoms; clinical studies report torques large enough to cause similar errors during needle insertions. Such angle discrepancies will result in poor performance or failure of path planners and image-guided controllers, since the needles used in percutaneous procedures are too small for state-of-the-art imaging to accurately measure the tip angle. To compensate for the angle discrepancy, we develop an estimator using a mechanics-based model of the rotational dynamics of a needle being inserted into tissue. Compared to controllers that assume a rigid needle in a frictionless environment, our estimator-based controller improves the tip angle convergence time by nearly 50\% and reduces the path deviation of the needle by 70\%.},

	abstract = {As a flexible needle with a bevel tip is pushed through soft tissue, the                     asymmetry of the tip causes the needle to bend. We propose that, by using                     nonholonomic kinematics, control, and path planning, an appropriately designed                     needle can be steered through tissue to reach a specified 3D target. Such                     steering capability could enhance targeting accuracy and may improve outcomes                     for percutaneous therapies, facilitate research on therapy effectiveness, and                     eventually enable new minimally invasive techniques. In this paper, we consider                     a first step toward active needle steering: design and experimental validation                     of a nonholonomic model for steering flexible needles with bevel tips. The model                     generalizes the standard three degree-of-freedom (DOF) nonholonomic unicycle and                     bicycle models to 6 DOF using Lie group theory. Model parameters are fit using                     experimental data, acquired via a robotic device designed for the specific                     purpose of inserting and steering a flexible needle. The experiments                     quantitatively validate the bevel-tip needle steering model, enabling future                     research in flexible needle path planning, control, and simulation.},

	abstract = {Flexible needles with bevel tips are being developed as useful tools for minimally invasive surgery and percutaneous therapy. When such a needle is inserted into soft tissue, it bends due to the asymmetric geometry of the bevel tip. This insertion with bending is not completely repeatable. We characterize the deviations in needle tip pose (position and orientation) by performing repeated needle insertions into artificial tissue. The base of the needle is pushed at a constant speed without rotating, and the covariance of the distribution of the needle tip pose is computed from experimental data. We develop the closed-form equations to describe how the covariance varies with different model parameters. We estimate the model parameters by matching the closed-form covariance and the experimentally obtained covariance. In this work, we use a needle model modified from a previously developed model with two noise parameters. The modified needle model uses three noise parameters to better capture the stochastic behavior of the needle insertion. The modified needle model provides an improvement of the covariance error from 26.1\% to 6.55\%.},

Steering can be achieved using a variety of mechanisms, including tip-based steering, lateral manipulation, and applying forces to the tissue as the needle is inserted. Models of these steering mechanisms can predict needle trajectory based on steering commands, motivating new preoperative path planning algorithms. These planning algorithms can be integrated with emerging needle imaging technology to achieve intraoperative closed-loop guidance and control of steerable needles.},

Based on the stochastic model for the needles, we develop a new framework for path planning of a flexible needle with a bevel tip. This consists of three parts: (a) approximation of probability density functions for the needle tip pose; (b) application of a second order error propagation algorithm on the Euclidean motion group; and (c) application of the path-of-probability (POP) algorithm. The probability density functions are approximated as Gaussians under the assumption that the uncertainty in the needle insertion is fairly small. The means and the covariances for the probability density functions are estimated using the error propagation algorithm that has second order accuracy. The POP algorithm is adapted to the path planning for the flexible needles so as to give the appropriate steering plan. Combining these components and considering 5 degree-of-freedom targets, the new method gives the path of the flexible needle that hits the target point with the desired hitting direction.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 10 biopsies were performed with 18-gauge (G) core biopsy needle via a percutaneous transperineal approach. Needle placement error was assessed by comparing the coordinates of preplanned targets with the needle tip measured from the intraprocedural coherent gradient echo images. The source of these errors was subsequently investigated by measuring displacement caused by needle deflection and needle susceptibility artifact shift in controlled phantom studies. Needle placement error due to misalignment of the needle template guide was also evaluated.
RESULTS: The mean and standard deviation (SD) of errors in targeted biopsies was 6.5 +/- 3.5 mm. Phantom experiments showed significant placement error due to needle deflection with a needle with an asymmetrically beveled tip (3.2-8.7 mm depending on tissue type) but significantly smaller error with a symmetrical bevel (0.6-1.1 mm). Needle susceptibility artifacts observed a shift of 1.6 +/- 0.4 mm from the true needle axis. Misalignment of the needle template guide contributed an error of 1.5 +/- 0.3 mm.
CONCLUSION: Needle placement error was clinically significant in MRI-guided biopsy for diagnosis of prostate cancer. Needle placement error due to needle deflection was the most significant cause of error, especially for needles with an asymmetrical bevel.},

The robot-assisted minimally-invasive surgery is well recognized as a feasible solution for diagnosis and treatment of the prostate cancer in human.

Methods
In this paper the kinematics of a parallel 4 Degrees-of-Freedom (DOF) surgical manipulator designed for minimally invasive in-bore prostate percutaneous interventions through the patient's perineum. The proposed manipulator takes advantage of 4 sliders actuated by MRI-compatible piezoelectric motors and incremental rotary encoders. Errors, mostly originating from the design and manufacturing process, need to be identified and reduced before the robot is deployed in the clinical trials.

Results
The manipulator has undergone several experiments to evaluate the repeatability and accuracy of the needle placement which is an essential concern in percutaneous prostate interventions.

Conclusion
The acquired results endorse the sustainability, precision (about 1 mm in air (in x or y direction) at the needle's reference point) and reliability of the manipulator.},

	abstract = {A new method for MRI needle tracking within a given two-dimensional (2D) image slice is presented. The method is based on k-space investigation of the difference image between the current dynamic frame and a reference frame. Using only a few central k-lines of the difference image and a nonlinear optimization procedure, one can resolve the parameters that define the 2D sinc function that best characterizes the needle in k-space. The spatial location and orientation of the needle are determined from these parameters. Rapid needle tracking is obtained by repeated acquisitions of the same set of several central k-lines (as in a “keyhole” protocol) and repeated computation of these parameters. The calculated needle tip is depicted on the reference image by means of a graphic overlay. The procedure was tested in computer simulations and in actual MRI scans (the computations were done offline). It was demonstrated that six k-lines out of 128 usually suffice to locate the needle. The refresh rate of the needle location depends on the time required to sample the subset of k-lines, calculate the current needle location, and refresh the reference image.

In the system, the robot control unit, the MRI scanner, and the open-source navigation software are connected together via Ethernet to exchange commands, coordinates, and images using an open network communication protocol, OpenIGTLink. The system has six states called “workphases” that provide the necessary synchronization of all components during each stage of the clinical workflow, and the user interface guides the operator linearly through these workphases. On top of this framework, the software provides the following features for needle guidance: interactive target planning; 3D image visualization with current needle position; treatment monitoring through real-time MR images of needle trajectories in the prostate. These features are supported by calibration of robot and image coordinates by fiducial-based registration. Performance tests show that the registration error of the system was 2.6 mm within the prostate volume. Registered real-time 2D images were displayed 1.97 s after the image location is specified.},

With increasing research on system integration for image-guided therapy (IGT), there has been a strong demand for standardized communication among devices and software to share data such as target positions, images and device status.

Method
We propose a new, open, simple and extensible network communication protocol for IGT, named OpenIGTLink, to transfer transform, image and status messages. We conducted performance tests and use-case evaluations in five clinical and engineering scenarios.

Results
The protocol was able to transfer position data with submillisecond latency up to 1024 fps and images with latency of {\textless}10 ms at 32 fps. The use-case tests demonstrated that the protocol is feasible for integrating devices and software.

Conclusion
The protocol proved capable of handling data required in the IGT setting with sufficient time resolution and latency. The protocol not only improves the interoperability of devices and software but also promotes transitions of research prototypes to clinical applications..},

Targeting biopsy lesions of MRI abnormality presents substantial clinical potential for the management of prostate cancer., The paper describes MRI-Safe requirements, presents the kinematic architecture, design and construction of the robot, and a comprehensive set of preclinical tests for MRI compatibility and needle targeting accuracy. The robot has a compact and simple 3 degree-of-freedom (DoF) structure, two for orienting a needle-guide and one to preset the depth of needle insertion. The actual insertion is performed manually through the guide and up to the preset depth. To reduce the complexity and size of the robot next to the patient, the depth setting DoF is remote., Experimental results show that the robot is safe to use in any MRI environment (MRI-Safe). Comprehensive MRI tests show that the presence and motion of the robot in the MRI scanner cause virtually no image deterioration or signal to noise ratio (SNR) change. Robot’s accuracy in bench test, CT-guided in-vitro, MRI-guided in-vitro and animal tests are 0.37mm, 1.10mm, 2.09mm, and 2.58mm respectively. These values are acceptable for clinical use.},

During such procedures, accurate needle tip placement is critical for correct diagnosis or successful treatment. Accurate placement of the needle tip inside tissue is challenging, especially when the target moves and anatomical obstacles must be avoided. We develop a needle steering system capable of autonomously and accurately guiding a steerable needle using two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound images. The needle is steered to a moving target while avoiding moving obstacles in a three-dimensional (3D) non-static environment. Using a 2D ultrasound imaging device, our system accurately tracks the needle tip motion in 3D space in order to estimate the tip pose. The needle tip pose is used by a rapidly exploring random tree-based motion planner to compute a feasible needle path to the target. The motion planner is sufficiently fast such that replanning can be performed repeatedly in a closed-loop manner. This enables the system to correct for perturbations in needle motion, and movement in obstacle and target locations. Our needle steering experiments in a soft-tissue phantom achieves maximum targeting errors of 0.86 ± 0.35 mm (without obstacles) and 2.16 ± 0.88 mm (with a moving obstacle).},

The development of an inexpensive system for flexible percutaneous intracranial navigation may be of significant clinical benefit.OBJECTIVE:Utilizing duty-cycled spinning of a flexible bevel-tipped needle, the authors devised and tested a means of achieving nonlinear trajectories for the navigation of catheters in the brain, which may be applicable to a wide variety of neurological diseases.METHODS:Exploiting the bending tendency of bevel-tipped needles due to their asymmetry, the authors devised and tested a means of generating curvilinear trajectories by spinning a needle with a variable duty cycle (ie, in on-off fashion). The technique can be performed using image guidance, and trajectories can be adjusted intraoperatively via joystick. Fifty-eight navigation trials were performed during cadaver testing to demonstrate the efficacy of the needle-steering system and to test its precision.RESULTS:The needle-steering system achieved a target acquisition error of 2 ± 1 mm, while demonstrating the ability to reach multiple targets from one burr hole using trajectories of varying curvature.CONCLUSION:The accuracy of the needle-steering system was demonstrated in a cadaveric model.

Needle-based procedures are commonly performed using intra-operative image guidance. 2D ultrasound is one of the most commonly used imaging modalities in clinics. It is portable, inexpensive and free of ionizing radiation. The success of the needle-based procedures depends on accurate detection of the needle. The accuracy of the out-of-plane detection, where the ultrasound transducer is placed at a right angle to the long-axis of the needle, depends on the ultrasound beam width. Finite width of the ultrasound beam and uniform cross-section of the needle introduce errors in tracking. The accuracy of in-plane tracking depends on the tracking algorithm used and the spatial resolution of the ultrasound transducer. This work presents a method to quantify the finite ultrasound beam width and the spatial accuracy of the transducer. An out-of-plane detection method was implemented to locate the tip of the discretely actuated steerable cannula. An in-plane tracking algorithm based on optical flow was also developed to obtain the shape of a planar cannula. The algorithms and the methods developed in this work are general and they can be extended to needles having straight, curved and arbitrary shapes.},

Accurately delivering the needle at a specific location in the human body is of importance for the clinical outcome of the procedure. Studies have already shown that robotically inserting traditional needles with a bevel tip can improve targeting accuracy. However, steering of such needles requires spinning the needle, which may lead to additional tissue damage. Therefore, we propose a novel design consisting of a flexible needle with a tendon-driven actuated-tip. Changing the orientation of the actuated-tip allows to control the steering direction of the needle and the amount of deflection. We derive the kinematic model which describes the needle path given the actuated-tip orientation based on nonholonomic kinematics. We present a method for steering the needle towards a target location in soft tissue. This method incorporates online parameter estimation in order to adapt for changes in tissue stiffness. Needle insertion experiments are performed in soft-tissue simulants, made from porcine gelatin. Needle tip pose is measured during insertion using Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) based shape reconstruction. Results show that the needle can be steered towards targets located at 20 mm from the initial insertion axis, at a depth of 100 mm with a mean targeting error of 2.02 mm.},

However, it is crucial to maintain tactile force feedback in MRI-guided needle-based procedures. This paper presents a Fabry-Perot interference (FPI) based system of an MRI-compatible fiber optic sensor which has been integrated into a piezoelectrically actuated robot for prostate cancer biopsy and brachytherapy in 3T MRI scanner. The opto-electronic sensing system design was minimized to fit inside an MRI-compatible robot controller enclosure. A flexure mechanism was designed that integrates the FPI sensor fiber for measuring needle insertion force, and finite element analysis was performed for optimizing the correct force-deformation relationship. The compact, low-cost FPI sensing system was integrated into the robot and calibration was conducted. The root mean square (RMS) error of the calibration among the range of 0–10 Newton was 0.318 Newton comparing to the theoretical model which has been proven sufficient for robot control and teleoperation.},

	abstract = {Needle-based percutaneous pelvic interventions often require multiple insertion attempts to reach sufficient targeting accuracy. Repeated needle insertions lead to lengthened
procedure time, increased cost and unnecessary discomfort to
the patient. An actuated needle driver suitable for the MR
environment was developed and evaluated herein. It is config-
ured for hands-on cooperative control of needle insertion under
real-time MR imaging, also capable of active compensation
of deflections from the intended insertion path through au-
tonomous bevel tipped needle rotation. Cooperatively controlled
needle insertions were performed into multi-layered phantoms
under real-time MR imaging. User input and needle forces
were captured to evaluate the cooperative insertion architecture,
where needle insertion velocity was shown to be a function of
the two. Additionally, transitions between phantom layers can
be easily detected. Furthermore, needle rotation was performed
under real-time MR imaging showing active compensation can
be performed during continuous cooperative insertions. Finally,
the robot’s effect on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was performed
with maximum signal loss less than 16\% in a single worst case,
and less than 3\% in all others.},

In this paper, an image-guided control system is developed to robotically steer flexible needles with an asymmetric tip. Knowledge about needle deflection is required for accurate steering. Two different models to predict needle deflection are presented. The first is a kinematics-based model, and the second model predicts needle deflection that is based on the mechanics of needle-tissue interaction. Both models predict deflection of needles that undergo multiple bends. The maximum targeting errors of the kinematics-based and the mechanics-based models for 110-mm insertion distance using a φ 0.5-mm needle are 0.8 and 1.7 mm, respectively. The kinematics-based model is used in the proposed image-guided control system. The control system accounts for target motion during the insertion procedure by detecting the target position in each image frame. Five experimental cases are presented to validate the real-time control system using both camera and ultrasound images as feedback. The experimental results show that the targeting errors of camera and ultrasound image-guided steering toward a moving target are 0.35 and 0.42 mm, respectively. The targeting accuracy of the algorithm is sufficient to reach the smallest lesions (φ 2 mm) that can be detected using the state-of-the-art ultrasound imaging systems.},

	abstract = {Needle-based procedures are commonly performed for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Imaging modalities are used to visualize the needle tip and the target during these needle insertion procedures. Among the available imaging techniques, magnetic resonance (MR) offers the best tissue contrast, where detection of an early stage cancer is possible. MR-guided needle insertions are currently performed with rigid needles, which have limited steerability. Flexible needles have been introduced to increase the steerability during the insertion. In this paper, we present a preliminary evaluation of a steering method for flexible bevel-tipped needles using MR as an imaging modality. The steering algorithm uses a needle deflection model to predict the tip motion and calculate the optimal rotation to reach the target. The best sequence of rotations are defined by an optimization algorithm based on the Nelder-Mead technique. The needle tip and the target are manually tracked through a graphical user interface. The needle is inserted by a device fabricated with MR-compatible material. The MR-guided flexible needle steering is evaluated by a series of insertions in two phantoms with real obstacles and targets. The average targeting error with flexible needles is 4.3mm, which is 28\% lower than the values reported in the literature with rigid needles. The results indicate the feasibility of MR-guided flexible needle insertions.},

	abstract = {Purpose
To evaluate the validity of different approaches to determine the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in MRI experiments with multi-element surface coils, parallel imaging, and different reconstruction filters.
Materials and Methods
Four different approaches of SNR calculation were compared in phantom measurements and in vivo based on: 1) the pixel-by-pixel standard deviation (SD) in multiple repeated acquisitions; 2) the signal statistics in a difference image; and 3) and 4) the statistics in two separate regions of a single image employing either the mean value or the SD of background noise. Different receiver coil systems (with one and eight channels), acquisitions with and without parallel imaging, and five different reconstruction filters were compared.
Results
Averaged over all phantom measurements, the deviations from the reference value provided by the multiple-acquisitions method are 2.7\% (SD 1.6\%) for the difference method, 37.7\% (25.9\%) for the evaluation of the mean value of background noise, and 34.0\% (38.1\%) for the evaluation of the SD of background noise.
Conclusion
The conventionally determined SNR based on separate signal and noise regions in a single image will in general not agree with the true SNR measured in images after the application of certain reconstruction filters, multichannel reconstruction, or parallel imaging.

	abstract = {Purpose:

Phantoms are a vital step for the preliminary validation of new image-guided procedures. In this paper, the authors present a deformable prostate phantom for use with multimodal imaging (end-fire or side-fire ultrasound, CT and MRI) and more specifically for transperineal or transrectal needle-insertion procedures. It is made of soft polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastic and includes a prostate, a perineum, a rectum, a soft periprostatic surrounding and embedded targets for image registration and needle-targeting. Its main particularity is its realistic deformability upon manipulation.


Methods:

After a detailed manufacturing description, the imaging and mechanical characteristics of the phantom are described and evaluated. First, the speed of sound and stress-strain relationship of the PVC material used in the phantom are described, followed by an analysis of its storage, imaging, needle-insertion force, and deformability characteristics.


Results:

The average speed of sound in the phantom was measured to be 1380 ± 20 m/s, while the stress-strain relationship was found to be viscoelastic and in the range of typical prostatic tissues. The mechanical and imaging characteristics of the phantom were found to remain stable at cooler storage temperatures. The phantom had clearly distinguishable morphology in all three imaging modalities, with embedded targets that could be precisely segmented, resulting in an average US-CT rigid registration error of 0.66 mm. The mobility of the phantom prostate upon needle insertion was between 2 and 4 mm, with rotations between 0° and 2°, about the US probe head.


Conclusion:

The phantom's characteristics compare favorably within vitro and in vivo measurements found in the literature. The authors believe that this realistic phantom could be of use to researchers studying new needle-based prostate diagnosis and therapy techniques.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To develop a mathematical model for the determination of total areas under curves from various metabolic studies.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In Tai's Model, the total area under a curve is computed by dividing the area under the curve between two designated values on the X-axis (abscissas) into small segments (rectangles and triangles) whose areas can be accurately calculated from their respective geometrical formulas. The total sum of these individual areas thus represents the total area under the curve. Validity of the model is established by comparing total areas obtained from this model to these same areas obtained from graphic method (less than +/- 0.4\%). Other formulas widely applied by researchers under- or overestimated total area under a metabolic curve by a great margin.
RESULTS: Tai's model proves to be able to 1) determine total area under a curve with precision; 2) calculate area with varied shapes that may or may not intercept on one or both X/Y axes; 3) estimate total area under a curve plotted against varied time intervals (abscissas), whereas other formulas only allow the same time interval; and 4) compare total areas of metabolic curves produced by different studies.
CONCLUSIONS: The Tai model allows flexibility in experimental conditions, which means, in the case of the glucose-response curve, samples can be taken with differing time intervals and total area under the curve can still be determined with precision.},

First, we propose an algorithm for generating configurable marker dictionaries (in size and number of bits) following a criterion to maximize the inter-marker distance and the number of bit transitions. In the process, we derive the maximum theoretical inter-marker distance that dictionaries of square binary markers can have. Second, a method for automatically detecting the markers and correcting possible errors is proposed. Third, a solution to the occlusion problem in augmented reality applications is shown. To that aim, multiple markers are combined with an occlusion mask calculated by color segmentation. The experiments conducted show that our proposal obtains dictionaries with higher inter-marker distances and lower false negative rates than state-of-the-art systems, and provides an effective solution to the occlusion problem.},

	doi = {10.1109/ICRA.2017.7989564},
	abstract = {The use of magnetic resonance (MR) images for needle-based interventions offers several advantages over other types of imaging modalities (e.g., high tissue contrast and no radiation). However, MR-guided interventions face challenges related to electromagnetic compatibility of medical devices and real-time tracking of surgical instruments. This work presents a flexible needle steering system that combines an MR-compatible robot and a Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG)-based needle tip tracker. The MR images are used to localize obstacles and targets, while the FBG sensors provide strain measurements for online estimation of the needle tip position. A pre-operative planner defines the needle entry point and desired path, while a model predictive controller calculates the needle rotation during the insertion. To the best of the authors knowledge, this is the first work that fuses MR images and FBG-based tracking to steer a flexible needle in closed-loop inside the MR bore. The system is validated by steering a bevel-tipped flexible needle towards a physical target in gelatin phantoms and biological tissues. The needle reaches the target in all trials with an average targeting error of 2.76 mm. Disregarding the target displacement during the insertion, the average targeting error drops to 1.74 mm. The preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of combining MR images and FBG-based needle tip tracking to steer a flexible needle in clinical procedures. In order to move towards to a clinically-relevant application, the design of a flexible Nitinol biopsy needle is also presented and evaluated by experiments in a prostate of a bull. The flexible needle presented a curvature 2.5 times larger than a conventional biopsy needle while maintaining the ability to collect tissue samples.},

	abstract = {Exact determination of needle tip position is obsolete for interventional procedures under control of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Exact needle tip navigation is complicated by the paramagnetism of microsurgical instruments: Local magnetic field inhomogeneities are induced resulting in position encoding artifacts and in signal voids in the surrounding of instruments and especially near their tips. The artifacts generated by the susceptibility of the material are not only dependent on the material properties themselves and on the applied MRI sequences and parameters, but also on the geometric shape of the instruments and on the orientation to the static magnetic field in the MR unit. A numerical model based on superposition of induced elementary dipole fields was developed for studying the field distortions near paramagnetic needle tips. The model was validated by comparison with experimental data using field mapping MRI techniques. Comparison between experimental data and numerical simulations revealed good correspondence for the induced field inhomogeneities. Further systematic numerical studies of the field distribution were performed for variable types of concentric and asymmetric tip shapes, for different ratios between tip length and needle diameter, and for different orientations of the needle axis in the external static magnetic field. Based on the computed local inhomogeneities of the magnetic field in the surroundings of the needle tips, signal voids in usual gradient echo images were simulated for a prediction of the artifacts. The practically relevant spatial relation between those artifacts and the hidden tip of the needle was calculated for the different tip shapes and orientations in the external field. As needle tip determination is crucial in interventional procedures, e.g., in taking biopsies, the present model can help to instruct the physician prior to surgical interventions in better estimating the needle tip position for different orientations and needle tip shapes as they appear in interventional procedures. As manufacturing prototypes with subsequent measurements of artifacts in MRI are a costly procedure the presented model may also help to optimize shapes of needle tips and of other parts of MR-compatible instruments and implants with low expense prior to production if some shape parameters can be chosen freely.},

Ten prostate cancer patients underwent HDR-BT during which the sagittally assisted sagittally reconstructed (SASR) segmentation technique was completed in parallel with commercially available sagittally assisted axially reconstructed (SAAR) TRUS for comparison. The SASR technique makes use of live 2D ultrasound intraoperatively and allows needle tip updates using the final 3D image in the absence of image artifacts. These updates were repeated offline twice by two separate users. Needle end-length measurements were used to calculate insertion depth errors (IDEs) for each technique. Images of 147 needles were analyzed. For the SASR technique, both users were confident in tip positions on the final 3D image within 3 mm for 52\% of needles, so these tip positions were updated. For the remaining 48\% of needles, the tip positions from the live 2D images were used. This SASR technique enabled the localization of all needles with IDEs within ±3 mm for 84\% of needles and IDE range of [−6.2 mm, 5.9 mm], compared with 57\% and [−8.1 mm, 7.7 mm] when using the commercially available SAAR technique. The SASR technique mitigates the impact of 3D TRUS image artifacts on HDR-BT needle tip localization by incorporating live 2D sagittal TRUS intraoperatively and provides a statistically significant reduction in IDE variance compared with the routine SAAR technique.},

	abstract = {Radiographs are commonly used to assess articular reduction of the distal tibia (pilon) fractures postoperatively, but may reveal malreductions inaccurately. While magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) are potential three-dimensional (3D) alternatives they generate metal-related artifacts. This study aims to quantify the artifact size from orthopaedic screws using CT, 1.5T and 3T MRI data. Three screws were inserted into one intact human cadaver ankle specimen proximal to and along the distal articular surface, then CT, 1.5T and 3T MRI scanned. Four types of screws were investigated: titanium alloy (TA), stainless steel (SS) (Ø =3.5 mm), cannulated TA (CTA) and cannulated SS (CSS) (Ø =4.0 mm, Ø empty core =2.6 mm). 3D artifact models were reconstructed using adaptive thresholding. The artifact size was measured by calculating the perpendicular distance from the central screw axis to the boundary of the artifact in four anatomical directions with respect to the distal tibia. The artifact sizes (in the order of TA, SS, CTA and CSS) from CT were 2.0, 2.6, 1.6 and 2.0 mm; from 1.5T MRI they were 3.7, 10.9, 2.9, and 9 mm; and 3T MRI they were 4.4, 15.3, 3.8, and 11.6 mm respectively. Therefore, CT can be used as long as the screws are at a safe distance of about 2 mm from the articular surface. MRI can be used if the screws are at least 3 mm away from the articular surface except for SS and CSS. Artifacts from steel screws were too large thus obstructed the pilon from being visualised in MRI. Significant differences (P{\textless}0.05) were found in the size of artifacts between all imaging modalities, screw types and material types, except 1.5T versus 3T MRI for the SS screws (P=0.063). CTA screws near the joint surface can improve postoperative assessment in CT and MRI. MRI presents a favourable non-ionising alternative when using titanium hardware. Since these factors may influence the quality of postoperative assessment, potential improvements in operative techniques should be considered.},

The goal was to provide a framework for biopsy approach and imaging technique parameter selection that will ensure the safety and accuracy of MR-guided procedures.Eight titanium and stainless steel alloy MR-compatible biopsy devices were immersed in fluid phantoms and placed into 1.5- and 0.2-T MR systems used for clinical imaging. Spin-echo, turbo spin-echo, and gradient-echo images were obtained with the needle shafts of the biopsy devices placed parallel to, perpendicular to, and at angles of 30 degrees and 60 degrees relative to the static magnetic field of the scanner. All images were obtained with the frequency-encoding direction parallel to and perpendicular to the needle shaft. Needle width and tip position were measured from images on a freestanding workstation, and the apparent tip position was compared with that obtained by direct measurement. The difference between these values was calculated for each needle type, imaging sequence, frequency-encoding direction, and needle orientation.Artifactual widening was much more apparent at 1.5 T than at 0.2 T, as was error in determining needle tip position. Artifacts at both field strengths were most pronounced with gradient-echo sequences, less so with turbo spin-echo sequences, and least of all with spin-echo sequences. For spin-echo and turbo spin-echo sequences, when the frequency-encoding axis was perpendicular to the needle shaft, the apparent width of the needle was larger, but error in needle tip position was smaller. Artifacts were much less apparent, but error in tip position increased, as the orientation of the needle shaft became more parallel to the direction of the magnetic field.Specific measurements differed with field strength, but needle tip localization within 1 mm was obtained at both 0.2 and 1.5 T with the appropriate frequency-encoding direction, pulse sequence, and imaging parameters. Orientation of the needle parallel to the magnetic field significantly reduced the apparent width of the needle at both field strengths but also decreased the accuracy of needle tip position localization.},

In the past few years several attempts have been made to aid in the understanding of susceptibility artifacts by means of simulation studies. Although these studies, which were mostly carried out with simple test objects, have produced some qualitative insight into χ-artifacts, the results lacked precision in describing finer details. In this paper we show the discrepancy between theory and experiment in previous work to be the result of an inadequate theoretical approach. In most studies so far, ΔB0 effects are taken into account in the frequency domain, that is, after Fourier transformation of the data. In our view the simulation should follow the actual sequence of events in an imaging experiment and deal with the effect of error fields in the time domain (k-space) already. The correctness of this view is demonstrated here by comparing the results of time and frequency domain simulation against experimental observation for a coaxial cylinder phantom, a widely used model in this type of work. Having established the superiority of the time domain simulation, we demonstrate its use in predicting χ-artifacts under various experimental conditions, for example, in spin-echo and gradient-echo imaging with a reduced number of phaseencoding steps.},

	abstract = {Purpose

To accelerate simulation of off-resonance artifacts in steady-state gradient echo MRI by using fast Fourier transforms and demonstrate its applicability to metal object localization.


Theory and Methods

By exploiting the repetitive nature of steady-state pulse sequences it is possible to use fast Fourier transforms to calculate the MR signal. Based on this principle, a method for fast simulation of off-resonance artifacts was designed. The method was validated against Bloch simulations and MRI scans. Its clinical relevance was demonstrated by employing it for template matching-based metal object localization, as applied to a titanium cylinder, an oxidized zirconium knee implant, and gold fiducials.


Results

The fast simulations were accurate compared with actual MRI scans of the objects. The differences between the fast simulations and Bloch simulations were minor, while the acceleration scaled linearly with the number of phase-encoding lines. The object localization method accurately localized the various metal objects.


Conclusion

The proposed simulation methodology provided accurate 3D simulations of off-resonance artifacts with a lower computational complexity than Bloch simulations. The speed of the simulations opens up possibilities in image reconstructions involving off-resonance phenomena that were previously infeasible due to computational limitations, as demonstrated for metal object localization.

	abstract = {An MR-only radiotherapy planning (RTP) workflow would reduce the cost, radiation exposure and uncertainties introduced by CT-MRI registrations. In the case of prostate treatment, one of the remaining challenges currently holding back the implementation of an RTP workflow is the MR-based localisation of intraprostatic gold fiducial markers (FMs), which is crucial for accurate patient positioning. Currently, MR-based FM localisation is clinically performed manually. This is sub-optimal, as manual interaction increases the workload. Attempts to perform automatic FM detection often rely on being able to detect signal voids induced by the FMs in magnitude images. However, signal voids may not always be sufficiently specific, hampering accurate and robust automatic FM localisation. Here, we present an approach that aims at automatic MR-based FM localisation. This method is based on template matching using a library of simulated complex-valued templates, and exploiting the behaviour of the complex MR signal in the vicinity of the FM. Clinical evaluation was performed on seventeen prostate cancer patients undergoing external beam radiotherapy treatment. Automatic MR-based FM localisation was compared to manual MR-based and semi-automatic CT-based localisation (the current gold standard) in terms of detection rate and the spatial accuracy and precision of localisation. The proposed method correctly detected all three FMs in 15/17 patients. The spatial accuracy (mean) and precision (STD) were 0.9 mm and 0.5 mm respectively, which is below the voxel size of \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/0031-9155/62/20/7981/pmbaa875fieqn001.gif] \$1.1 {\textbackslash}times 1.1 {\textbackslash}times 1.2\$ mm 3 and comparable to MR-based manual localisation. FM localisation failed (3/51 FMs) in the presence of bleeding or calcifications in the direct vicinity of the FM. The method was found to be spatially accurate and precise, which is essential for clinical use. To overcome any missed detection, we envision the use of the proposed method along with verification by an observer. This will result in a semi-automatic workflow facilitating the introduction of an MR-only workflow.},

	abstract = {Purpose:

The feasibility of radiation therapy treatment planning using substitute computed tomography (sCT) generated from magnetic resonance images (MRIs) has been demonstrated by a number of research groups. One challenge with an MRI-alone workflow is the accurate identification of intraprostatic gold fiducial markers, which are frequently used for prostate localization prior to each dose delivery fraction. This paper investigates a template-matching approach for the detection of these seeds in MRI.


Methods:

Two different gradient echo T1 and T2* weighted MRI sequences were acquired from fifteen prostate cancer patients and evaluated for seed detection. For training, seed templates from manual contours were selected in a spectral clustering manifold learning framework. This aids in clustering “similar” gold fiducial markers together. The marker with the minimum distance to a cluster centroid was selected as the representative template of that cluster during training. During testing, Gaussian mixture modeling followed by a Markovian model was used in automatic detection of the probable candidates. The probable candidates were rigidly registered to the templates identified from spectral clustering, and a similarity metric is computed for ranking and detection.


Results:

A fiducial detection accuracy of 95\% was obtained compared to manual observations. Expert radiation therapist observers were able to correctly identify all three implanted seeds on 11 of the 15 scans (the proposed method correctly identified all seeds on 10 of the 15).


Conclusions:

An novel automatic framework for gold fiducial marker detection in MRI is proposed and evaluated with detection accuracies comparable to manual detection. When radiation therapists are unable to determine the seed location in MRI, they refer back to the planning CT (only available in the existing clinical framework); similarly, an automatic quality control is built into the automatic software to ensure that all gold seeds are either correctly detected or a warning is raised for further manual intervention.},

	abstract = {The introduction of a magnetic resonance (MR)-only workflow in radiotherapy requires that fiducial markers, used for position verification, can be detected on MR images. Here we evaluate a model for marker detection in prostate cancer patients by combining information from our hospital standard multi-parametric (mp-) MRI protocol (T1-weighted – T1w, T2-weighted – T2w, B0) with dedicated sequences (balanced steady-state free precession sequence – bTFE, susceptibility weighted imaging – SWI). Thirty two patients scheduled for external-beam radiotherapy received a mp-MRI and computed-tomography; the latter was used as ground truth location of the markers. A logistic regression model was implemented for marker detection by combining features from all imaging sequences. The performance of the individual and combined sequences was assessed by determining true and false positive detections. The combination of different sequences (mp-MRI) resulted in a better performance than the best imaging sequence alone (bTFE). Combining mp-MRI+bTFE resulted in good accuracy and a true positive detection rate of 0.94. The standard mp-MRI provides valuable information to detect fiducial markers. The combination of different sequences outperforms the use of a single dedicated sequence. We recommend the addition of a bTFE to the standard mp-MRI protocol to improve fiducial marker detection.},

	abstract = {The gynecological cancer mortality rate, including cervical, ovarian, vaginal and vulvar cancers, is more than 20,000 annually in the US alone. In many countries, including the US, external-beam radiotherapy followed by high dose rate brachytherapy is the standard-of-care. The superior ability of MR to visualize soft tissue has led to an increase in its usage in planning and delivering brachytherapy treatment. A technical challenge associated with the use of MRI imaging for brachytherapy, in contrast to that of CT imaging, is the visualization of catheters that are used to place radiation sources into cancerous tissue. We describe here a precise, accurate method for achieving catheter segmentation and visualization. The algorithm, with the assistance of manually provided tip locations, performs segmentation using image-features, and is guided by a catheter-specific, estimated mechanical model. A final quality control step removes outliers or conflicting catheter trajectories. The mean Hausdorff error on a 54 patient, 760 catheter reference database was 1.49 mm; 51 of the outliers deviated more than two catheter widths (3.4 mm) from the gold standard, corresponding to catheter identification accuracy of 93\% in a Syed-Neblett template. In a multi-user simulation experiment for evaluating RMS precision by simulating varying manually-provided superior tip positions, 3σ maximum errors were 2.44 mm. The average segmentation time for a single catheter was 3 seconds on a standard PC. The segmentation time, accuracy and precision, are promising indicators of the value of this method for clinical translation of MR-guidance in gynecologic brachytherapy and other catheter-based interventional procedures.},

This paper presents a validation study of a novel image-processing method for catheter segmentation. The method extends the distal catheter tip, interactively provided by the physician, to its proximal end, using knowledge of catheter geometry and appearance in MRI sequences. The validation study consisted of comparison of the algorithm results to expert manual segmentations, first on images of a phantom, and then on patient MRI images obtained during MRI-guided insertion of brachytherapy catheters for the treatment of gynecologic cancer. In the phantom experiment, the maximum disagreement between automatic and manual segmentation of the same MRI image, as computed using the Hausdorf distance, was 1.5 mm, which is of the same order as the MR image spatial resolution, while the disagreement between automatic segmentation of MR images and “ground truth”, manual segmentation of CT images, was 3.5mm. The segmentation method was applied to an IRB-approved retrospective database of 10 interstitial brachytherapy patients which included a total of 101 catheters. Compared with manual expert segmentations, the automatic method correctly segmented 93 out of 101 catheters, at an average rate of 0.3 seconds per catheter using a 3GHz Intel Core i7 computer with 16 GB RAM and running Mac OS X 10.7. These results suggest that the proposed catheter segmentation is both technically and clinically feasible.},

	abstract = {Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is widely used in routine clinical diagnosis and treatment. However, variations in MRI acquisition protocols result in different appearances of normal and diseased tissue in the images. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which have shown to be successful in many medical image analysis tasks, are typically sensitive to the variations in imaging protocols. Therefore, in many cases, networks trained on data acquired with one MRI protocol, do not perform satisfactorily on data acquired with different protocols. This limits the use of models trained with large annotated legacy datasets on a new dataset with a different domain which is often a recurring situation in clinical settings. In this study, we aim to answer the following central questions regarding domain adaptation in medical image analysis: Given a fitted legacy model, 1) How much data from the new domain is required for a decent adaptation of the original network?; and, 2) What portion of the pre-trained model parameters should be retrained given a certain number of the new domain training samples? To address these questions, we conducted extensive experiments in white matter hyperintensity segmentation task. We trained a CNN on legacy MR images of brain and evaluated the performance of the domain-adapted network on the same task with images from a different domain. We then compared the performance of the model to the surrogate scenarios where either the same trained network is used or a new network is trained from scratch on the new dataset.The domain-adapted network tuned only by two training examples achieved a Dice score of 0.63 substantially outperforming a similar network trained on the same set of examples from scratch.},

	abstract = {Deep learning models have outperformed some of the previous state-of-the-art approaches in medical image analysis. Instead of using hand-engineered features, deep models attempt to automatically extract hierarchical representations at multiple levels of abstraction from the data. Therefore, deep models are usually considered to be more flexible and robust solutions for image analysis problems compared to conventional computer vision models. They have demonstrated significant improvements in computer-aided diagnosis and automatic medical image analysis applied to such tasks as image segmentation, classification and registration. However, deploying deep learning models often has a steep learning curve and requires detailed knowledge of various software packages. Thus, many deep models have not been integrated into the clinical research workflows causing a gap between the state-of-the-art machine learning in medical applications and evaluation in clinical research procedures. In this paper, we propose “DeepInfer” – an open-source toolkit for developing and deploying deep learning models within the 3D Slicer medical image analysis platform. Utilizing a repository of task-specific models, DeepInfer allows clinical researchers and biomedical engineers to deploy a trained model selected from the public registry, and apply it to new data without the need for software development or configuration. As two practical use cases, we demonstrate the application of DeepInfer in prostate segmentation for targeted MRI-guided biopsy and identification of the target plane in 3D ultrasound for spinal injections.},

	abstract = {Purpose

An MR-only postimplant dosimetry workflow for low dose rate (LDR) brachytherapy could reduce patient burden, improve accuracy, and improve cost efficiency. However, localization of brachytherapy seeds on MRI scans remains a major challenge for this type of workflow. In this study, we propose and validate an MR-only seed localization method and identify remaining challenges.


Methods and materials

The localization method was based on template matching of simulations of complex-valued imaging artifacts around metal brachytherapy seeds. The method was applied to MRI scans of 25 prostate cancer patients who underwent LDR brachytherapy and for whom postimplant dosimetry was performed after 4 weeks. The seed locations found with the MR-only method were validated against the seed locations found on CT. The circumstances in which detection errors were made were classified to gain an insight in the nature of the errors.


Results

A total of 1490 of 1557 (96\%) seeds were correctly detected, while 67 false-positive errors were made. The correctly detected seed locations had a high spatial accuracy with an average error of 0.8 mm compared with CT. A majority of the false positives occurred near other seeds. Most false negatives were found in either stranded configurations without spacers or near other seeds.


Conclusions

The low detection error rate and high localization accuracy obtained by the complex-valued template matching approach are promising for future clinical application of MR-only dosimetry. The most important remaining challenge is robustness with regard to configurations of multiple seeds in close vicinity, such as in strands of seeds without spacers. This issue could potentially be resolved by simulating specific configurations of multiple seeds or by constraining the treatment planning to avoid these configurations, which could make the proposed method competitive with CT-based seed localization.},

	abstract = {MRI-guided prostate biopsy in conventional closed-bore scanners requires transferring the patient outside the bore during needle insertion due to the constrained in-bore space, causing a safety hazard and limiting image feedback. To address this issue, we present our custom-made in-bore setup and software to support MRI-guided transperineal prostate biopsy in a wide-bore 3 Tesla (T) MRI scanner. The setup consists of a specially designed tabletop and a needle-guiding template with Z-frame that give a physician access to the perineum of the patient at the imaging position and allow performance of MRI-guided transperineal biopsy without moving the patient out of the scanner. The software and Z-frame allow registration of the template, target planning, and biopsy guidance. Initially, we performed phantom experiments to assess the accuracy of template registration and needle placement in a controlled environment. Subsequently, we embarked on our clinical trial (N = 10). The phantom experiments showed that the translational errors of the template registration along the right-left (RP) and anterior-posterior (AP) axes were 1.1 ± 0.8 mm and 1.4 ± 1.1 mm respectively, while the rotational errors around the RL, AP, and superior-inferior axes were 0.8 ± 1.0 degrees, 1.7 ± 1.6 degrees, and 0.0 ± 0.0 degrees respectively. The 2D root-mean-square (RMS) needle placement error was 3.0 mm. The clinical biopsy procedures were safely carried out in all ten clinical cases with a needle placement error of 5.4 mm (2D RMS). In conclusion, transperineal prostate biopsy in a wide-bore 3T scanner is feasible using our custom-made tabletop set up and software, which supports manual needle placement without moving the patient out of the magnet.},

To develop and evaluate image registration methodology for automated re-identification of tumor-suspicious foci from pre-procedural MR exams during MR-guided transperineal prostate core biopsy.

Materials and Methods
A hierarchical approach for automated registration between planning and intra-procedural T2-weighted prostate MRI was developed and evaluated on the images acquired during 10 consecutive MR-guided biopsies. Registration accuracy was quantified at image-based landmarks and by evaluating spatial overlap for the manually segmented prostate and sub-structures. Registration reliability was evaluated by simulating initial mis-registration and analyzing the convergence behavior. Registration precision was characterized at the planned biopsy targets.

Results
The total computation time was compatible with a clinical setting, being at most 2 minutes. Deformable registration led to a significant improvement in spatial overlap of the prostate and peripheral zone contours compared to both rigid and affine registration. Average in-slice landmark registration error was 1.3±0.5 mm. Experiments simulating initial mis-registration resulted in an estimated average capture range of 6 mm and an average in-slice registration precision of ±0.3 mm.

Conclusion
Our registration approach requires minimum user interaction and is compatible with the time constraints of our interventional clinical workflow. The initial evaluation shows acceptable accuracy, reliability and consistency of the method.},

We present a force model for needle insertion and experimental procedures for acquiring data from ex vivo tissue to populate that model. Data were collected from bovine livers using a one-degree-of-freedom robot equipped with a load cell and needle attachment. computed tomography imaging was used to segment the needle insertion process into phases identifying different relative velocities between the needle and tissue. The data were measured and modeled in three parts: 1) capsule stiffness, a nonlinear spring model; 2) friction, a modified Karnopp model; and 3) cutting, a constant for a given tissue. In addition, we characterized the effects of needle diameter and tip type on insertion force using a silicone rubber phantom. In comparison to triangular and diamond tips, a bevel tip causes more needle bending and is more easily affected by tissue density variations. Forces for larger diameter needles are higher due to increased cutting and friction forces.},

Steering such needles along curved paths allows one to avoid anatomical obstacles and reach locations inside the human body which are unreachable with rigid needles. In this study, a mechanics-based model is presented which predicts needle deflection for a needle undergoing multiple bends during insertion into soft tissue. The model is based on a Rayleigh-Ritz formulation, and inputs to the model are a force at the needle tip and a distributed load which acts along the needle shaft. Experiments are used to evaluate the distributed load, and needle deflection is then predicted using the model. The results of the model are compared with a kinematics-based model. Maximum errors in final tip deflection are found to be 0.5 mm and 0.6 mm for the mechanics-based and kinematics-based model, respectively. Though both models are found to be comparable, the mechanics-based model can account for deflection when the needle radius of curvature is not constant (e.g., biological tissue).},

In this paper, an image-guided control system is developed to robotically steer flexible needles with an asymmetric tip. Knowledge about needle deflection is required for accurate steering. Two different models to predict needle deflection are presented. The first is a kinematics-based model, and the second model predicts needle deflection that is based on the mechanics of needle-tissue interaction. Both models predict deflection of needles that undergo multiple bends. The maximum targeting errors of the kinematics-based and the mechanics-based models for 110-mm insertion distance using a φ 0.5-mm needle are 0.8 and 1.7 mm, respectively. The kinematics-based model is used in the proposed image-guided control system. The control system accounts for target motion during the insertion procedure by detecting the target position in each image frame. Five experimental cases are presented to validate the real-time control system using both camera and ultrasound images as feedback. The experimental results show that the targeting errors of camera and ultrasound image-guided steering toward a moving target are 0.35 and 0.42 mm, respectively. The targeting accuracy of the algorithm is sufficient to reach the smallest lesions (φ 2 mm) that can be detected using the state-of-the-art ultrasound imaging systems.},

	abstract = {Needle insertion is one of the most commonly performed minimally invasive procedures. Visualization of the needle during insertion is key for either successful diagnosis or therapy. This work presents the real-time three-dimensional tracking of flexible needles during insertion into a soft-tissue simulant using a two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound transducer. The transducer is placed perpendicular to the needle tip to measure its position. During insertion the transducer is robotically repositioned to track the needle tip. Positioning of the transducer is accomplished by a compensator, that uses the needle insertion velocity corrected by needle tip velocities to determine out-of-plane motion. Experiments are performed to validate the needle tip pose during tracking. The maximum mean errors in needle tip position along the x-, y- and z-axes are 0.64 mm, 0.25 mm and 0.27 mm, respectively. The error in tip orientations (θ-about the y-axis and φ-about the z-axis) are 2.68° and 2.83°, respectively. This study demonstrates the ability to compute the needle tip pose using a 2D ultrasound transducer.

	abstract = {The tip asymmetry of a bevel-tip needle results in the needle naturally bending when it is inserted into soft tissue. This enables robotic needle steering, which can be used in medical procedures to reach subsurface targets inaccessible by straight-line trajectories. However, accurate path planning and control of needle steering require models of needle-tissue interaction. Previous kinematic models required empirical observations of each needle and tissue combination in order to fit model parameters. This study describes a mechanics-based model of robotic needle steering, which can be used to predict needle behavior and optimize system design based on fundamental mechanical and geometrical properties of the needle and tissue. We first present an analytical model for the loads developed at the tip, based on the geometry of the bevel edge and material properties of soft-tissue simulants (gels). We then present a mechanics-based model that calculates the deflection of a bevel-tipped needle inserted through a soft elastic medium. The model design is guided by microscopic observations of needle-gel interactions. The energy-based formulation incorporates tissue-specific parameters, and the geometry and material properties of the needle. Simulation results follow similar trends (deflection and radius of curvature) to those observed in experimental studies of robotic needle insertion.},

In this paper, we develop a three-dimensional (3D) closed-loop control algorithm to robotically steer flexible needles with an asymmetric tip towards a target in a soft-tissue phantom. Twelve Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors are embedded on the needle shaft. FBG sensors measure the strain applied on the needle during insertion. A method is developed to reconstruct the needle shape using the strain data obtained from the FBG sensors. Four experimental cases are conducted to validate the reconstruction method (single-bend, double-bend, 3D double-bend and drilling insertions). In the experiments, the needle is inserted 120 mm into a soft-tissue phantom. Camera images are used as a reference for the reconstruction experiments. The results show that the mean needle tip accuracy of the reconstruction method is 1.8 mm. The reconstructed needle shape is used as feedback for the steering algorithm. The steering algorithm estimates the region that the needle can reach during insertion, and controls the needle to keep the target in this region. Steering experiments are performed for 110 mm insertion, and the mean targeting accuracy is 1.3 mm. The results demonstrate the capability of using FBG sensors to robotically steer needles.},

Using data from these experiments, cohesive elements are calibrated and then implemented in models for validation of the needle insertion process. Successful modelling enables direct comparison of finite element and experimental force–displacement plots and energy distributions. Regions of crack creation, relaxation, cutting and full penetration are identified. By closing the loop between experiments and detailed finite element modelling, a methodology is established which will enable design modifications of a soft tissue probe that steers through complex mechanical interactions with the surrounding material.},

Users only need to provide a background mesh which is not necessarily conforming to the boundaries/interfaces of the simulated object. The details of the surface, which can be directly obtained from binary images, are taken into account by a multilevel embedding algorithm applied to elements of the background mesh that cut by the surface. Boundary conditions can be implicitly imposed on the surface using Lagrange multipliers. The implementation is verified by convergence studies with optimal rates. The algorithm is applied to various needle insertion simulations (e.g. for biopsy or brachytherapy) into brain and liver to verify the reliability of method, and numerical results show that the present method can make the discretisation independent from geometric description, and can avoid the complexity of mesh generation of complex geometries while retaining the accuracy of the standard FEM. Using the proposed approach is very suitable for real-time and patient specific simulations as it improves the simulation accuracy by taking into account automatically and properly the simulated geometry.},

This is the first model that predicts both needle shape and tip position in soft tissue, and accepts needle insertion velocity, needle 180° axial rotation, and needle base force/torque as inputs. A hybrid formulation of needle steering dynamics in soft tissue is presented, which considers the needle as a two-body rigid/flexible coupled system composed of a moving, discrete, and rigid part attached to a vibrating compliant part that is subject to external excitation forces. The former is the carrier representing the surgeon's hand or the needle inserting robot, while the latter is a beam modeling the continuous deflection of the needle inside tissue. A novel time-delayed tissue model and a fracture mechanics-based model are developed to model the tissue reaction forces and cutting force at the needle tip, respectively. Experiments are performed on synthetic and ex vivo animal tissues to identify the model parameters and validate the needle steering model. The maximum error of the 2-D model in predicting the needle tip position in the insertion plane was 1.59 mm in the case of no axial rotation and 0.74 mm with axial rotation.},

	abstract = {We present a prototype of a flexible nitinol needle (φ 1.0 mm and length 172 mm) integrated with an array of 12 Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors. These sensors measure the axial strain, which enables the computation of the needle curvature. We reconstruct the three-dimensional (3-D) needle shape from the curvature. Experiments are performed where the needle is deflected in free space. The maximum errors between the experiments and beam theory-based model are 0.20 mm (in-plane deflection with single bend), 0.51 mm (in-plane deflection with double bend), and 1.66 mm (out-of-plane). We also describe kinematics-based and mechanics-based models for predicting the 3-D needle shape during insertion into soft tissue. We perform experiments where the needle is inserted into a soft-tissue simulant, and the 3-D needle shape is reconstructed using the FBG sensors. We compare the reconstructed needle shape to deflection obtained from camera images and our models. The maximum error between the experiments and the camera images is 0.74 mm. The maximum errors between the kinematics-based and mechanics-based models and the camera images are 3.77 mm and 2.20 mm, respectively. This study demonstrates that deflection models and needles integrated with FBG sensors have the potential to be used in combination with clinical imaging modalities in order to enable accurate needle steering.},

	abstract = {In needle-based medical procedures, beveled tip flexible needles are steered inside soft tissue to reach the desired target locations. In this paper, we have developed an autonomous image-guided needle steering system that enhances targeting accuracy in needle insertion while minimizing tissue trauma. The system has three main components. First is a novel mechanics-based needle steering model that predicts needle deflection and accepts needle tip rotation as an input for needle steering. The second is a needle tip tracking system that determines needle deflection from the ultrasound images. The needle steering model employs the estimated needle deflection at the present time to predict needle tip trajectory in the future steps. The third component is a nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) that steers the needle inside the tissue by rotating the needle beveled tip. The MPC controller calculates control decisions based on iterative optimization of the predictions of the needle steering model. To validate the proposed ultrasound-guided needle steering system, needle insertion experiments in biological tissue phantoms are performed in two cases–with and without obstacle. The results demonstrate that our needle steering strategy guides the needle to the desired targets with the maximum error of 2.85{\textless}math display="inline" overflow="scroll" altimg="eq-00001.gif"{\textgreater}{\textless}mspace width=".17em"{\textgreater}{\textless}/mspace{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater}mm.},

	abstract = {Percutaneous needle insertion is amongst the most prevalent clinical procedures. The effectiveness of needle-base interventions heavily relies on needle targeting accuracy. However, the needle interacts with the surrounding tissue during insertion and deflects away from its intended trajectory. To overcome this problem, a significant research effort has been made towards developing robotic systems to automatically steer bevel-tipped needles percutaneously, which is a comprehensive and challenging control problem. A flexible needle inserted in soft tissue is an under-actuated system with nonholonomic constraints. Closed-loop feedback control of needle in tissue is challenging due to measurement errors, unmodelled dynamics created by tissue heterogeneity, and motion of targets within the tissue. In this paper, we review recent progress made in each of the complementary components that constitute a closed-loop needle steering system, including modelling needle-tissue interaction, sensing needle deflection, controlling needle trajectory, and hardware implementation.},

	abstract = {In this letter, we present a model for needle deflection estimation in soft tissue. The needle is modelled as a vibrating compliant cantilever beam that experiences forces applied by the tissue as it is inserted. Each of the assumed vibration modes are associated with a weighting coefficient whose magnitude is calculated using the minimum potential energy method. The model only requires as input the tissue stiffness and needle-tissue cutting force. Contributions of this letter include the estimation of needle-tissue contact forces as a function of the tissue displacement along the needle shaft, while allowing for multiple bends of the needle. The model is combined with partial ultrasound image feedback in order to adaptively calculate the needle-tissue cutting force as the needle is inserted. The image feedback is obtained by an ultrasound probe that follows the needle tip and stops at an appropriate position to avoid further tissue displacement. Images obtained during early stages of the insertion are used to predict the deflection of the needle further along the insertion process. Experimental results in biological and phantom tissue show an average error in predicting needle deflection of 0.36 mm.},

	abstract = {The tip asymmetry of a bevel-tip needle results in the needle naturally bending when it is inserted into soft tissue. This enables robotic needle steering, which can be used in medical procedures to reach subsurface targets inaccessible by straight-line trajectories. However, accurate path planning and control of needle steering require models of needle-tissue interaction. Previous kinematic models required empirical observations of each needle and tissue combination in order to fit model parameters. This study describes a mechanics-based model of robotic needle steering, which can be used to predict needle behavior and optimize system design based on fundamental mechanical and geometrical properties of the needle and tissue. We first present an analytical model for the loads developed at the tip, based on the geometry of the bevel edge and material properties of soft-tissue simulants (gels). We then present a mechanics-based model that calculates the deflection of a bevel-tipped needle inserted through a soft elastic medium. The model design is guided by microscopic observations of needle-gel interactions. The energy-based formulation incorporates tissue-specific parameters, and the geometry and material properties of the needle. Simulation results follow similar trends (deflection and radius of curvature) to those observed in experimental studies of robotic needle insertion.},

	title = {Interactive {Simulation} of {Surgical} {Needle} {Insertion} and {Steering}},
	abstract = {We present algorithms for simulating and visualizing the insertion and steering of needles through deformable tissues for surgical training and planning. Needle insertion is an essential component of many clinical procedures such as biopsies, injections, neurosurgery, and brachytherapy cancer treatment. The success of these procedures depends on accurate guidance of the needle tip to a clinical target while avoiding vital tissues. Needle insertion deforms body tissues, making accurate placement diﬃcult. Our interactive needle insertion simulator models the coupling between a steerable needle and deformable tissue. We introduce (1) a novel algorithm for local remeshing that quickly enforces the conformity of a tetrahedral mesh to a curvilinear needle path, enabling accurate computation of contact forces, (2) an eﬃcient method for coupling a 3D ﬁnite element simulation with a 1D inextensible rod with stick-slip friction, and (3) optimizations that reduce the computation time for physically based simulations. We can realistically and interactively simulate needle insertion into a prostate mesh of 13,375 tetrahedra and 2,763 vertices at a 25 Hz frame rate on an 8-core 3.0 GHz Intel Xeon PC. The simulation models prostate brachytherapy with needles of varying stiﬀness, steering needles around obstacles, and supports motion planning for robotic needle insertion. We evaluate the accuracy of the simulation by comparing against real-world experiments in which ﬂexible, steerable needles were inserted into gel tissue phantoms.},

The needle insertion point, needle heading, and needle depth are optimized by minimizing the distance between a rigid needle and a number of targets in the tissue. The optimization method is based on iterative simulations performed using a tissue finite element model. At each iteration, the best 3-D line fitted to the displaced targets in the deformed tissue is used as a candidate for a new insertion line. First, this method is implemented in a prostate brachytherapy simulator under different boundary conditions to minimize the targeting error. It is shown that the optimization method converges in a few iterations and decreases the seed misplacement error to less than the needle diameter. Second, the efficacy of the optimization algorithm is verified by optimizing the insertion parameters for a brachytherapy needle before insertion into a prostate tissue phantom. The elastic properties of the phantom and the needle-tissue interaction parameters were identified in an independent experiment. The optimization algorithm is effective in decreasing the targeting error.},
